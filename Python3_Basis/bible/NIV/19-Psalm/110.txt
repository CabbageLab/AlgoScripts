#Psalm 110

#Of David. A psalm.

The Lord says to my lord: “Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.”

The Lord will extend your mighty scepter from Zion, saying, “Rule in the midst of your enemies!”

Your troops will be willing on your day of battle. Arrayed in holy splendor, your young men will come to you like dew from the morning’s womb.

The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind: “You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.”

The Lord is at your right hand; he will crush kings on the day of his wrath.

He will judge the nations, heaping up the dead and crushing the rulers of the whole earth.

He will drink from a brook along the way, and so he will lift his head high.
