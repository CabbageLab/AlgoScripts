#Psalm 56

#For the director of music. To the tune of “A Dove on Distant Oaks.” Of David. A miktam. When the Philistines had seized him in Gath.

Be merciful to me, my God, for my enemies are in hot pursuit; all day long they press their attack.

My adversaries pursue me all day long; in their pride many are attacking me.

When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.

In God, whose word I praise— in God I trust and am not afraid. What can mere mortals do to me?

All day long they twist my words; all their schemes are for my ruin.

They conspire, they lurk, they watch my steps, hoping to take my life.

Because of their wickedness do not let them escape; in your anger, God, bring the nations down.

Record my misery; list my tears on your scroll— are they not in your record?

Then my enemies will turn back when I call for help. By this I will know that God is for me.

In God, whose word I praise, in the Lord, whose word I praise—

in God I trust and am not afraid. What can man do to me?

I am under vows to you, my God; I will present my thank offerings to you.

For you have delivered me from death and my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before God in the light of life.
