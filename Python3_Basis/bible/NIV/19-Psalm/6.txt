#Psalm 6

#For the director of music. With stringed instruments. According to sheminith. A psalm of David.

Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.

Have mercy on me, Lord, for I am faint; heal me, Lord, for my bones are in agony.

My soul is in deep anguish. How long, Lord, how long?

Turn, Lord, and deliver me; save me because of your unfailing love.

Among the dead no one proclaims your name. Who praises you from the grave?

I am worn out from my groaning. All night long I flood my bed with weeping and drench my couch with tears.

My eyes grow weak with sorrow; they fail because of all my foes.

Away from me, all you who do evil, for the Lord has heard my weeping.

The Lord has heard my cry for mercy; the Lord accepts my prayer.

All my enemies will be overwhelmed with shame and anguish; they will turn back and suddenly be put to shame.
