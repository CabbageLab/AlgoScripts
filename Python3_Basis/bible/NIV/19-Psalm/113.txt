#Psalm 113

Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord, you his servants; praise the name of the Lord.

Let the name of the Lord be praised, both now and forevermore.

From the rising of the sun to the place where it sets, the name of the Lord is to be praised.

The Lord is exalted over all the nations, his glory above the heavens.

Who is like the Lord our God, the One who sits enthroned on high,

who stoops down to look on the heavens and the earth?

He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap;

he seats them with princes, with the princes of his people.

He settles the childless woman in her home as a happy mother of children. Praise the Lord.
