#Psalm 72

#Of Solomon.

Endow the king with your justice, O God, the royal son with your righteousness.

May he judge your people in righteousness, your afflicted ones with justice.

May the mountains bring prosperity to the people, the hills the fruit of righteousness.

May he defend the afflicted among the people and save the children of the needy; may he crush the oppressor.

May he endure as long as the sun, as long as the moon, through all generations.

May he be like rain falling on a mown field, like showers watering the earth.

In his days may the righteous flourish and prosperity abound till the moon is no more.

May he rule from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth.

May the desert tribes bow before him and his enemies lick the dust.

May the kings of Tarshish and of distant shores bring tribute to him. May the kings of Sheba and Seba present him gifts.

May all kings bow down to him and all nations serve him.

For he will deliver the needy who cry out, the afflicted who have no one to help.

He will take pity on the weak and the needy and save the needy from death.

He will rescue them from oppression and violence, for precious is their blood in his sight.

Long may he live! May gold from Sheba be given him. May people ever pray for him and bless him all day long.

May grain abound throughout the land; on the tops of the hills may it sway. May the crops flourish like Lebanon and thrive like the grass of the field.

May his name endure forever; may it continue as long as the sun. Then all nations will be blessed through him, and they will call him blessed.

Praise be to the Lord God, the God of Israel, who alone does marvelous deeds.

Praise be to his glorious name forever; may the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen and Amen.

This concludes the prayers of David son of Jesse.
