#Psalm 36

#For the director of music. Of David the servant of the Lord.

I have a message from God in my heart concerning the sinfulness of the wicked: There is no fear of God before their eyes.

In their own eyes they flatter themselves too much to detect or hate their sin.

The words of their mouths are wicked and deceitful; they fail to act wisely or do good.

Even on their beds they plot evil; they commit themselves to a sinful course and do not reject what is wrong.

Your love, Lord, reaches to the heavens, your faithfulness to the skies.

Your righteousness is like the highest mountains, your justice like the great deep. You, Lord, preserve both people and animals.

How priceless is your unfailing love, O God! People take refuge in the shadow of your wings.

They feast on the abundance of your house; you give them drink from your river of delights.

For with you is the fountain of life; in your light we see light.

Continue your love to those who know you, your righteousness to the upright in heart.

May the foot of the proud not come against me, nor the hand of the wicked drive me away.

See how the evildoers lie fallenâ€” thrown down, not able to rise!
