#Psalm 26

#Of David.

Vindicate me, Lord, for I have led a blameless life; I have trusted in the Lord and have not faltered.

Test me, Lord, and try me, examine my heart and my mind;

for I have always been mindful of your unfailing love and have lived in reliance on your faithfulness.

I do not sit with the deceitful, nor do I associate with hypocrites.

I abhor the assembly of evildoers and refuse to sit with the wicked.

I wash my hands in innocence, and go about your altar, Lord,

proclaiming aloud your praise and telling of all your wonderful deeds.

Lord, I love the house where you live, the place where your glory dwells.

Do not take away my soul along with sinners, my life with those who are bloodthirsty,

in whose hands are wicked schemes, whose right hands are full of bribes.

I lead a blameless life; deliver me and be merciful to me.

My feet stand on level ground; in the great congregation I will praise the Lord.
