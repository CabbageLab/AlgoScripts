#God Implored to Confound His Enemies.

God, do not remain quiet; Do not be silent and, God, do not be still.

For behold, Your enemies make an uproar, And those who hate You have exalted themselves.

They make shrewd plans against Your people, And conspire together against Your treasured ones.

They have said, “Come, and let’s wipe them out as a nation, So that the name of Israel will no longer be remembered.”

For they have conspired together with one mind; They make a covenant against You:

The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagrites;

Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek, Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;

Assyria also has joined them; They have become a help to the children of Lot. Selah

¶Deal with them as with Midian, As with Sisera and Jabin at the river of Kishon,

Who were destroyed at En-dor, Who became like dung for the ground.

Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, And all their leaders like Zebah and Zalmunna,

Who said, “Let’s possess for ourselves The pastures of God.”

¶My God, make them like the whirling dust, Like chaff before the wind.

Like fire that burns the forest, And like a flame that sets the mountains on fire,

So pursue them with Your heavy gale, And terrify them with Your storm.

Fill their faces with dishonor, So that they will seek Your name, Lord.

May they be ashamed and dismayed forever, And may they be humiliated and perish,

So that they will know that You alone, whose name is the Lord, Are the Most High over all the earth.
