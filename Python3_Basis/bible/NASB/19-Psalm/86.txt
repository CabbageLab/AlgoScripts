#Pleading and Trust.

Incline Your ear, Lord, and answer me; For I am afflicted and needy.

Protect my soul, for I am godly; You my God, save Your servant who trusts in You.

Be gracious to me, Lord, For I call upon You all day long.

Make the soul of Your servant joyful, For to You, Lord, I lift up my soul.

For You, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive, And abundant in mercy to all who call upon You.

Listen, Lord, to my prayer; And give Your attention to the sound of my pleading!

On the day of my trouble I will call upon You, For You will answer me.

There is no one like You among the gods, Lord, Nor are there any works like Yours.

All nations whom You have made will come and worship before You, Lord, And they will glorify Your name.

For You are great, and You do wondrous deeds; You alone are God.

¶Teach me Your way, Lord; I will walk in Your truth; Unite my heart to fear Your name.

I will give thanks to You, Lord my God, with all my heart, And I will glorify Your name forever.

For Your graciousness toward me is great, And You have saved my soul from the depths of Sheol.

¶God, arrogant men have risen up against me, And a gang of violent men have sought my life, And they have not set You before them.

But You, Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, Slow to anger and abundant in mercy and truth.

Turn to me, and be gracious to me; Grant Your strength to Your servant, And save the son of Your maidservant.

Show me a sign of good, That those who hate me may see it and be ashamed, Because You, Lord, have helped me and comforted me.
