#Thanksgiving for the L

I will give You thanks with all my heart; I will sing Your praises before the gods.

I will bow down toward Your holy temple And give thanks to Your name for Your mercy and Your truth; For You have made Your word great according to all Your name.

On the day I called, You answered me; You made me bold with strength in my soul.

¶All the kings of the earth will give thanks to You, Lord, When they have heard the words of Your mouth.

And they will sing of the ways of the Lord, For great is the glory of the Lord.

For the Lord is exalted, Yet He looks after the lowly, But He knows the haughty from afar.

¶Though I walk in the midst of trouble, You will revive me; You will reach out with Your hand against the wrath of my enemies, And Your right hand will save me.

The Lord will accomplish what concerns me; Your faithfulness, Lord, is everlasting; Do not abandon the works of Your hands.
