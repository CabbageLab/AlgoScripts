#God Humbles the Proud, but Exalts the Righteous.

We give thanks to You, God, we give thanks, For Your name is near; People declare Your wondrous works.

“When I select an appointed time, It is I who judge fairly.

“The earth and all who inhabit it are unsteady; It is I who have firmly set its pillars. Selah

“I said to the boastful, ‘Do not boast,’ And to the wicked, ‘Do not lift up the horn;

Do not lift up your horn on high, Do not speak with insolent pride.’ ”

¶For not from the east, nor from the west, Nor from the desert comes exaltation;

But God is the Judge; He puts down one and exalts another.

For a cup is in the hand of the Lord, and the wine foams; It is well mixed, and He pours out of this; Certainly all the wicked of the earth must drain and drink its dregs.

¶But as for me, I will declare it forever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.

And He will cut off all the horns of the wicked, But the horns of the righteous will be lifted up.
