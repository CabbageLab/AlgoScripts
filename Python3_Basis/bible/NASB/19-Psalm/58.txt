#Prayer for the Punishment of the Wicked.

Do you indeed speak righteousness, you gods? Do you judge fairly, you sons of mankind?

No, in heart you practice injustice; On earth you clear a way for the violence of your hands.

The wicked have turned away from the womb; These who speak lies go astray from birth.

They have venom like the venom of a serpent; Like a deaf cobra that stops up its ear,

So that it does not hear the voice of charmers, Or a skillful caster of spells.

¶God, shatter their teeth in their mouth; Break out the fangs of the young lions, Lord.

May they flow away like water that runs off; When he aims his arrows, may they be as headless shafts.

May they be like a snail which goes along in slime, Like the miscarriage of a woman that never sees the sun.

Before your pots can feel the fire of thorns He will sweep them away with a whirlwind, the green and the burning alike.

¶The righteous will rejoice when he sees vengeance; He will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.

And people will say, “There certainly is a reward for the righteous; There certainly is a God who judges on the earth!”
