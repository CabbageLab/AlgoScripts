#The L

The Lord is my shepherd, I will not be in need.

He lets me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside quiet waters.

He restores my soul; He guides me in the paths of righteousness For the sake of His name.

Â¶Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.

You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You have anointed my head with oil; My cup overflows.

Certainly goodness and faithfulness will follow me all the days of my life, And my dwelling will be in the house of the Lord forever.
