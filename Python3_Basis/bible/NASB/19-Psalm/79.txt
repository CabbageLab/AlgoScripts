#Grieving over the Destruction of Jerusalem, and Prayer for Help.

God, the nations have invaded Your inheritance; They have defiled Your holy temple; They have laid Jerusalem in ruins.

They have given the dead bodies of Your servants to the birds of the sky as food, The flesh of Your godly ones to the animals of the earth.

They have poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem; And there was no one to bury them.

We have become a disgrace before our neighbors, An object of derision and ridicule to those around us.

How long, Lord? Will You be angry forever? Will Your jealousy burn like fire?

Pour out Your wrath upon the nations which do not know You, And upon the kingdoms which do not call upon Your name.

For they have devoured Jacob And laid waste his settlement.

¶Do not hold us responsible for the guilty deeds of our forefathers; Let Your compassion come quickly to meet us, For we have become very low.

Help us, God of our salvation, for the glory of Your name; And save us and forgive our sins for the sake of Your name.

Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?” Let vengeance for the blood of Your servants which has been shed Be known among the nations in our sight.

Let the groaning of the prisoner come before You; According to the greatness of Your power, let those who are doomed to die remain.

And return to our neighbors seven times as much into their lap Their taunts with which they have taunted You, Lord.

So we Your people and the sheep of Your pasture Will give thanks to You forever; To all generations we will tell of Your praise.
