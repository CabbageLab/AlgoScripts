#Confidence in God’s Protection.

Hear my cry, God; Give Your attention to my prayer.

From the end of the earth I call to You when my heart is faint; Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.

For You have been a refuge for me, A tower of strength against the enemy.

Let me dwell in Your tent forever; Let me take refuge in the shelter of Your wings. Selah

¶For You have heard my vows, God; You have given me the inheritance of those who fear Your name.

You will prolong the king’s life; His years will be like generations.

He will sit enthroned before God forever; Appoint faithfulness and truth that they may watch over him.

So I will sing praise to Your name forever, That I may pay my vows day by day.
