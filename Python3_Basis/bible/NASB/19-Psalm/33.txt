#Praise to the Creator and Protector.

Sing for joy in the Lord, you righteous ones; Praise is becoming to the upright.

Give thanks to the Lord with the lyre; Sing praises to Him with a harp of ten strings.

Sing to Him a new song; Play skillfully with a shout of joy.

For the word of the Lord is right, And all His work is done in faithfulness.

He loves righteousness and justice; The earth is full of the goodness of the Lord.

¶By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, And by the breath of His mouth all their lights.

He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap; He puts the depths in storehouses.

Let all the earth fear the Lord; Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him.

For He spoke, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood firm.

The Lord nullifies the plan of nations; He frustrates the plans of peoples.

The plan of the Lord stands forever, The plans of His heart from generation to generation.

Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord, The people He has chosen for His own inheritance.

¶The Lord looks from heaven; He sees all the sons of mankind;

From His dwelling place He looks out On all the inhabitants of the earth,

He who fashions the hearts of them all, He who understands all their works.

The king is not saved by a mighty army; A warrior is not rescued by great strength.

A horse is a false hope for victory; Nor does it rescue anyone by its great strength.

¶Behold, the eye of the Lord is on those who fear Him, On those who wait for His faithfulness,

To rescue their soul from death And to keep them alive in famine.

Our soul waits for the Lord; He is our help and our shield.

For our heart rejoices in Him, Because we trust in His holy name.

Let Your favor, Lord, be upon us, Just as we have waited for You.
