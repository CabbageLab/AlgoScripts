#Prayer for Rescue from Persecutors.

Be gracious to me, God, be gracious to me, For my soul takes refuge in You; And in the shadow of Your wings I will take refuge Until destruction passes by.

I will cry to God Most High, To God who accomplishes all things for me.

He will send from heaven and save me; He rebukes the one who tramples upon me. Selah God will send His favor and His truth.

¶My soul is among lions; I must lie among those who devour, Among sons of mankind whose teeth are spears and arrows, And their tongue is a sharp sword.

Be exalted above the heavens, God; May Your glory be above all the earth.

They have prepared a net for my steps; My soul is bowed down; They dug a pit before me; They themselves have fallen into the midst of it. Selah

¶My heart is steadfast, God, my heart is steadfast; I will sing, yes, I will sing praises!

Awake, my glory! Awake, harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn.

I will praise You, Lord, among the peoples; I will sing praises to You among the nations.

For Your goodness is great to the heavens And Your truth to the clouds.

Be exalted above the heavens, God; May Your glory be above all the earth.
