#The King of Glory Entering Zion.

The earth is the Lord’s, and all it contains, The world, and those who live in it.

For He has founded it upon the seas And established it upon the rivers.

Who may ascend onto the hill of the Lord? And who may stand in His holy place?

One who has clean hands and a pure heart, Who has not lifted up his soul to deceit And has not sworn deceitfully.

He will receive a blessing from the Lord And righteousness from the God of his salvation.

This is the generation of those who seek Him, Who seek Your face—even Jacob. Selah

¶Lift up your heads, you gates, And be lifted up, you ancient doors, That the King of glory may come in!

Who is the King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, The Lord mighty in battle.

Lift up your heads, you gates, And lift them up, you ancient doors, That the King of glory may come in!

Who is this King of glory? The Lord of armies, He is the King of glory. Selah
