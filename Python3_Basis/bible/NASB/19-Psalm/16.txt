#The L

Protect me, God, for I take refuge in You.

I said to the Lord, “You are my Lord; I have nothing good besides You.”

As for the saints who are on the earth, They are the majestic ones; all my delight is in them.

The pains of those who have acquired another god will be multiplied; I will not pour out their drink offerings of blood, Nor will I take their names upon my lips.

¶The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and my cup; You support my lot.

The measuring lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; Indeed, my inheritance is beautiful to me.

¶I will bless the Lord who has advised me; Indeed, my mind instructs me in the night.

I have set the Lord continually before me; Because He is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.

Therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoices; My flesh also will dwell securely.

For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol; You will not allow Your Holy One to undergo decay.

You will make known to me the way of life; In Your presence is fullness of joy; In Your right hand there are pleasures forever.
