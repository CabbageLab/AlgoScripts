#The Nations Exhorted to Praise God.

God be gracious to us and bless us, And cause His face to shine upon usâ€” Selah

That Your way may be known on the earth, Your salvation among all nations.

May the peoples praise You, God; May all the peoples praise You.

May the nations be glad and sing for joy; For You will judge the peoples with fairness And guide the nations on the earth. Selah

May the peoples praise You, God; May all the peoples praise You.

The earth has yielded its produce; God, our God, blesses us.

God blesses us, So that all the ends of the earth may fear Him.
