#God, a Helper against the Treacherous.

Help, Lord, for the godly person has come to an end, For the faithful have disappeared from the sons of mankind.

They speak lies to one another; They speak with flattering lips and a double heart.

May the Lord cut off all flattering lips, The tongue that speaks great things;

Who have said, “With our tongue we will prevail; Our lips are our own; who is lord over us?”

“Because of the devastation of the poor, because of the groaning of the needy, Now I will arise,” says the Lord; “I will put him in the safety for which he longs.”

¶The words of the Lord are pure words; Like silver refined in a furnace on the ground, filtered seven times.

You, Lord, will keep them; You will protect him from this generation forever.

The wicked strut about on every side When vileness is exalted among the sons of mankind.
