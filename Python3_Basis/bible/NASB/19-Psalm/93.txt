#The Majesty of the L

The Lord reigns, He is clothed with majesty; The Lord has clothed and encircled Himself with strength. Indeed, the world is firmly established; it will not be moved.

Your throne is established from of old; You are from eternity.

Â¶The floods have lifted up, Lord, The floods have lifted up their voice, The floods lift up their pounding waves.

More than the sounds of many waters, Than the mighty breakers of the sea, The Lord on high is mighty.

Your testimonies are fully confirmed; Holiness is pleasing to Your house, Lord, forevermore.
