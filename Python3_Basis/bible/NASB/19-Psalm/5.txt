#Prayer for Protection from the Wicked.

Listen to my words, Lord, Consider my sighing.

Listen to the sound of my cry for help, my King and my God, For to You I pray.

In the morning, Lord, You will hear my voice; In the morning I will present my prayer to You and be on the watch.

¶For You are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness; No evil can dwell with You.

The boastful will not stand before Your eyes; You hate all who do injustice.

You destroy those who speak lies; The Lord loathes the person of bloodshed and deceit.

But as for me, by Your abundant graciousness I will enter Your house, At Your holy temple I will bow in reverence for You.

¶Lord, lead me in Your righteousness because of my enemies; Make Your way straight before me.

For there is nothing trustworthy in their mouth; Their inward part is destruction itself. Their throat is an open grave; They flatter with their tongue.

Make them pay, God; Have them fall by their own schemes! Scatter them in the multitude of their wrongdoings, For they are rebellious against You.

¶But rejoice, all who take refuge in You, Sing for joy forever! And may You shelter them, That those who love Your name may rejoice in You.

For You bless the righteous person, Lord, You surround him with favor as with a shield.
