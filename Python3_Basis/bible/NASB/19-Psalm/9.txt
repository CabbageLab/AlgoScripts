#Thanksgiving for God’s Justice.

I will give thanks to the Lord with all my heart; I will tell of all Your wonders.

I will rejoice and be jubilant in You; I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.

¶When my enemies turn back, They stumble and perish before You.

For You have maintained my just cause; You have sat on the throne judging righteously.

You have rebuked the nations, You have eliminated the wicked; You have wiped out their name forever and ever.

The enemy has come to an end in everlasting ruins, And You have uprooted the cities; The very memory of them has perished.

¶But the Lord sits as King forever; He has established His throne for judgment,

And He will judge the world in righteousness; He will execute judgment for the peoples fairly.

The Lord will also be a stronghold for the oppressed, A stronghold in times of trouble;

And those who know Your name will put their trust in You, For You, Lord, have not abandoned those who seek You.

¶Sing praises to the Lord, who dwells in Zion; Declare His deeds among the peoples.

For He who requires blood remembers them; He does not forget the cry of the needy.

Be gracious to me, Lord; See my oppression from those who hate me, You who lift me up from the gates of death,

So that I may tell of all Your praises, That in the gates of the daughter of Zion I may rejoice in Your salvation.

The nations have sunk down into the pit which they have made; In the net which they hid, their own foot has been caught.

The Lord has made Himself known; He has executed judgment. A wicked one is ensnared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion Selah

¶The wicked will return to Sheol, All the nations who forget God.

For the needy will not always be forgotten, Nor the hope of the afflicted perish forever.

Arise, Lord, do not let mankind prevail; Let the nations be judged before You.

Put them in fear, Lord; Let the nations know that they are merely human. Selah
