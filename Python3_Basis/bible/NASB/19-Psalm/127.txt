#Prosperity Comes from the L

Unless the Lord builds a house, They who build it labor in vain; Unless the Lord guards a city, The watchman stays awake in vain.

It is futile for you to rise up early, To stay up late, To eat the bread of painful labor; This is how He gives to His beloved sleep.

¶Behold, children are a gift of the Lord, The fruit of the womb is a reward.

Like arrows in the hand of a warrior, So are the children of one’s youth.

Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them; They will not be ashamed When they speak with their enemies in the gate.
