#God Sustains His Servant.

I waited patiently for the Lord; And He reached down to me and heard my cry.

He brought me up out of the pit of destruction, out of the mud; And He set my feet on a rock, making my footsteps firm.

He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God; Many will see and fear And will trust in the Lord.

¶How blessed is the man who has made the Lord his trust, And has not turned to the proud, nor to those who become involved in falsehood.

Many, Lord my God, are the wonders which You have done, And Your thoughts toward us; There is no one to compare with You. If I would declare and speak of them, They would be too numerous to count.

¶You have not desired sacrifice and meal offering; You have opened my ears; You have not required burnt offering and sin offering.

Then I said, “Behold, I have come; It is written of me in the scroll of the book.

“I delight to do Your will, my God; Your Law is within my heart.”

¶I have proclaimed good news of righteousness in the great congregation; Behold, I will not restrain my lips, Lord, You know.

I have not hidden Your righteousness within my heart; I have spoken of Your faithfulness and Your salvation; I have not concealed Your mercy and Your truth from the great congregation.

¶You, Lord, will not withhold Your compassion from me; Your mercy and Your truth will continually watch over me.

For evils beyond number have surrounded me; My guilty deeds have overtaken me, so that I am not able to see; They are more numerous than the hairs of my head, And my heart has failed me.

¶Be pleased, Lord, to rescue me; Hurry, Lord, to help me.

May those be ashamed and humiliated together Who seek my life to destroy it; May those be turned back and dishonored Who delight in my hurt.

May those be appalled because of their shame Who say to me, “Aha, aha!”

May all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; May those who love Your salvation continually say, “The Lord be exalted!”

But I am afflicted and needy; May the Lord be mindful of me. You are my help and my savior; Do not delay, my God.
