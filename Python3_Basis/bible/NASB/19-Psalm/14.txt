#Foolishness and Wickedness of People.

The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt, they have committed detestable acts; There is no one who does good.

The Lord has looked down from heaven upon the sons of mankind To see if there are any who understand, Who seek God.

They have all turned aside, together they are corrupt; There is no one who does good, not even one.

¶Do all the workers of injustice not know, Who devour my people as they eat bread, And do not call upon the Lord?

There they are in great dread, For God is with a righteous generation.

You would put to shame the plan of the poor, But the Lord is his refuge.

¶Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! When the Lord restores the fortunes of His people, Jacob will rejoice, Israel will be glad.
