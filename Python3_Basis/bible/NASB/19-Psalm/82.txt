#Unjust Judgments Rebuked.

God takes His position in His assembly; He judges in the midst of the gods.

How long will you judge unjustly And show partiality to the wicked? Selah

Vindicate the weak and fatherless; Do justice to the afflicted and destitute.

Rescue the weak and needy; Save them from the hand of the wicked.

¶They do not know nor do they understand; They walk around in darkness; All the foundations of the earth are shaken.

I said, “You are gods, And all of you are sons of the Most High.

“Nevertheless you will die like men, And fall like one of the princes.”

Arise, God, judge the earth! For You possess all the nations.
