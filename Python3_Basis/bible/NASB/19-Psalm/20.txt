#Prayer for Victory over Enemies.

May the Lord answer you on a day of trouble! May the name of the God of Jacob protect you!

May He send you help from the sanctuary, And support you from Zion!

May He remember all your meal offerings And accept your burnt offering! Selah

¶May He grant you your heart’s desire And fulfill your whole plan!

We will sing for joy over your victory, And in the name of our God we will set up our banners. May the Lord fulfill all your desires.

¶Now I know that the Lord saves His anointed; He will answer him from His holy heaven With the saving strength of His right hand.

Some praise their chariots and some their horses, But we will praise the name of the Lord, our God.

They have bowed down and fallen, But we have risen and stood upright.

Save, Lord; May the King answer us on the day we call.
