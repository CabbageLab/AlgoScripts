#The Beauty and Glory of Zion.

Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised In the city of our God, His holy mountain.

Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, Is Mount Zion in the far north, The city of the great King.

In its palaces, God has made Himself known as a stronghold.

¶For, behold, the kings arrived, They passed by together.

They saw it,  then they were amazed; They were terrified, they fled in a hurry.

Panic seized them there, Anguish, as that of a woman in childbirth.

With the east wind You smash the ships of Tarshish.

Just as we have heard, so have we seen In the city of the Lord of armies, in the city of our God; God will establish her forever. Selah

¶We have thought over Your goodness, God, In the midst of Your temple.

As is Your name, God, So is Your praise to the ends of the earth; Your right hand is full of righteousness.

Mount Zion shall be glad, The daughters of Judah shall rejoice Because of Your judgments.

Walk around Zion and encircle her; Count her towers;

Consider her ramparts; Go through her palaces, So that you may tell of her to the next generation.

For such is God, Our God forever and ever; He will lead us until death.
