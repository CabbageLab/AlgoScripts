#The Excellency of Brotherly Unity.

Behold, how good and how pleasant it is For brothers to live together in unity!

It is like the precious oil on the head, Running down upon the beard, As on Aaron’s beard, The oil which ran down upon the edge of his robes.

It is like the dew of Hermon Coming down upon the mountains of Zion; For the Lord commanded the blessing there—life forever.
