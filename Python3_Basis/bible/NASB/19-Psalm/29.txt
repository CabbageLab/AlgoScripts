#The Voice of the L

Ascribe to the Lord, sons of the mighty, Ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.

Ascribe to the Lord the glory due His name; Worship the Lord in holy attire.

¶The voice of the Lord is on the waters; The God of glory thunders, The Lord is over many waters.

The voice of the Lord is powerful, The voice of the Lord is majestic.

The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars; Yes, the Lord breaks the cedars of Lebanon in pieces.

He makes Lebanon skip like a calf, And Sirion like a young wild ox.

The voice of the Lord divides flames of fire.

The voice of the Lord shakes the wilderness; The Lord shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.

The voice of the Lord makes the deer give birth And strips the forests bare; And in His temple everything says, “Glory!”

¶The Lord sat as King at the flood; Yes, the Lord sits as King forever.

The Lord will give strength to His people; The Lord will bless His people with peace.
