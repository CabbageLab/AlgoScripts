#God’s Rescue of Israel from Egypt.

When Israel went forth from Egypt, The house of Jacob from a people of a foreign language,

Judah became His sanctuary; Israel, His dominion.

¶The sea looked and fled; The Jordan turned back.

The mountains skipped like rams, The hills, like lambs.

What ails you, sea, that you flee? Jordan, that you turn back?

Mountains, that you skip like rams? Hills, like lambs?

¶Tremble, earth, before the Lord, Before the God of Jacob,

Who turned the rock into a pool of water, The flint into a fountain of water.
