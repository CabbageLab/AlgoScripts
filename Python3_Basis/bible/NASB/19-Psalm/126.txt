#Thanksgiving for Return from Captivity.

When the Lord brought back the captives of Zion, We were like those who dream.

Then our mouth was filled with laughter And our tongue with joyful shouting; Then they said among the nations, “The Lord has done great things for them.”

The Lord has done great things for us; We are joyful.

¶Restore our fortunes, Lord, As the streams in the South.

Those who sow in tears shall harvest with joyful shouting.

One who goes here and there weeping, carrying his bag of seed, Shall indeed come again with a shout of joy, bringing his sheaves with him.
