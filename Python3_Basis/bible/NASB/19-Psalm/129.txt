#Prayer for the Overthrow of Zion’s Enemies.

“Many times they have attacked me from my youth up,” Let Israel say,

“Many times they have attacked me from my youth up; Yet they have not prevailed against me.

“The plowers plowed upon my back; They lengthened their furrows.”

The Lord is righteous; He has cut up the ropes of the wicked.

¶May all who hate Zion Be put to shame and turned backward;

May they be like grass upon the housetops, Which withers before it grows up;

With which the harvester does not fill his hand, Or the binder of sheaves his arms;

Nor do those who pass by say, “The blessing of the Lord be upon you; We bless you in the name of the Lord.”
