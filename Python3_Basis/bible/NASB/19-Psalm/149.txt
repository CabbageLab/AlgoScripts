#Israel Invoked to Praise the L

Praise the Lord! Sing a new song to the Lord, And His praise in the congregation of the godly ones.

Israel shall be joyful in his Maker; The sons of Zion shall rejoice in their King.

They shall praise His name with dancing; They shall sing praises to Him with tambourine and lyre.

For the Lord takes pleasure in His people; He will glorify the lowly with salvation.

Â¶The godly ones shall be jubilant in glory; They shall sing for joy on their beds.

The high praises of God shall be in their mouths, And a two-edged sword in their hands,

To execute vengeance on the nations, And punishment on the peoples,

To bind their kings with chains, And their dignitaries with shackles of iron,

To execute against them the judgment written. This is an honor for all His godly ones. Praise the Lord!
