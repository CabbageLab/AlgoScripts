#Prayer for Help in Trouble.

I cry out with my voice to the Lord; With my voice I implore the Lord for compassion.

I pour out my complaint before Him; I declare my trouble before Him.

When my spirit felt weak within me, You knew my path. In the way where I walk They have hidden a trap for me.

Look to the right and see; For there is no one who regards me favorably; There is no escape for me; No one cares for my soul.

¶I cried out to You, Lord; I said, “You are my refuge, My portion in the land of the living.

“Give Your attention to my cry, For I have been brought very low; Rescue me from my persecutors, For they are too strong for me.

“Bring my soul out of prison, So that I may give thanks to Your name; The righteous will surround me, For You will look after me.”
