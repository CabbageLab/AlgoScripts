Praise the Lord! Praise Him,  you servants of the Lord, Praise the name of the Lord.

Blessed be the name of the Lord From this time on and forever.

From the rising of the sun to its setting, The name of the Lord is to be praised.

The Lord is high above all nations; His glory is above the heavens.

Â¶Who is like the Lord our God, Who is enthroned on high,

Who looks far down to The heavens and the earth?

He raises the poor from the dust, He lifts the needy from the garbage heap,

To seat them with noblemen, With the noblemen of His people.

He has the infertile woman live in the house As a joyful mother of children. Praise the Lord!
