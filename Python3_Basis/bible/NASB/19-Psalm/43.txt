#Prayer for Help.

Vindicate me, God, and plead my case against an ungodly nation; Save me from the deceitful and unjust person!

For You are the God of my strength; why have You rejected me? Why do I go about mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

¶Send out Your light and Your truth, they shall lead me; They shall bring me to Your holy hill And to Your dwelling places.

Then I will go to the altar of God, To God my exceeding joy; And I will praise You on the lyre, God, my God.

¶Why are you in despair, my soul? And why are you restless within me? Wait for God, for I will again praise Him For the help of His presence, my God.
