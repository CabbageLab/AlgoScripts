#Praise for Salvation.

Lord, in Your strength the king will be glad, And in Your salvation how greatly he will rejoice!

You have given him his heart’s desire, And You have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah

For You meet him with the blessings of good things; You set a crown of pure gold on his head.

He asked for life from You, You gave it to him, Length of days forever and ever.

His glory is great through Your salvation, Splendor and majesty You place upon him.

For You make him most blessed forever; You make him joyful with the joy of Your presence.

¶For the king trusts in the Lord, And through the faithfulness of the Most High he will not be shaken.

Your hand will find all your enemies; Your right hand will find those who hate you.

You will make them as a fiery oven in the time of your anger; The Lord will swallow them up in His wrath, And fire will devour them.

You will eliminate their descendants from the earth, And their children from among the sons of mankind.

Though they intended evil against You And devised a plot, They will not succeed.

For You will make them turn their back; You will take aim at their faces with Your bowstrings.

Be exalted, Lord, in Your strength; We will sing and praise Your power.
