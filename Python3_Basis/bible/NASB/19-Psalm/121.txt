#The L

I will raise my eyes to the mountains; From where will my help come?

My help comes from the Lord, Who made heaven and earth.

He will not allow your foot to slip; He who watches over you will not slumber.

Behold, He who watches over Israel Will neither slumber nor sleep.

Â¶The Lord is your protector; The Lord is your shade on your right hand.

The sun will not beat down on you by day, Nor the moon by night.

The Lord will protect you from all evil; He will keep your soul.

The Lord will guard your going out and your coming in From this time and forever.
