#Prayer for Help in Trouble.

How long, Lord? Will You forget me forever? How long will You hide Your face from me?

How long am I to feel anxious in my soul, With grief in my heart all the day? How long will my enemy be exalted over me?

¶Consider and answer me, O Lord my God; Enlighten my eyes, or I will sleep the sleep of death,

And my enemy will say, “I have overcome him,” And my adversaries will rejoice when I am shaken.

¶But I have trusted in Your faithfulness; My heart shall rejoice in Your salvation.

I will sing to the Lord, Because He has looked after me.
