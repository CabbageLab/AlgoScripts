#The L

I will exalt You, my God, the King, And I will bless Your name forever and ever.

Every day I will bless You, And I will praise Your name forever and ever.

Great is the Lord, and highly to be praised; And His greatness is unsearchable.

One generation will praise Your works to another, And will declare Your mighty acts.

On the glorious splendor of Your majesty And on Your wonderful works, I will meditate.

People will speak of the power of Your awesome acts, And I will tell of Your greatness.

They will burst forth in speaking of Your abundant goodness, And will shout joyfully of Your righteousness.

¶The Lord is gracious and compassionate; Slow to anger and great in mercy.

The Lord is good to all, And His mercies are over all His works.

All Your works will give thanks to You, Lord, And Your godly ones will bless You.

They will speak of the glory of Your kingdom, And talk of Your might,

To make known to the sons of mankind Your mighty acts, And the glory of the majesty of Your kingdom.

Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, And Your dominion endures throughout all generations. The Lord is faithful in His words, And holy in all His works.

¶The Lord supports all who fall, And raises up all who are bowed down.

The eyes of all look to You, And You give them their food in due time.

You open Your hand And satisfy the desire of every living thing.

¶The Lord is righteous in all His ways, And kind in all His works.

The Lord is near to all who call on Him, To all who call on Him in truth.

He will fulfill the desire of those who fear Him; He will also hear their cry for help and save them.

The Lord watches over all who love Him, But He will destroy all the wicked.

My mouth will speak the praise of the Lord, And all flesh will bless His holy name forever and ever.
