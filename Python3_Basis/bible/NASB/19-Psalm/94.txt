#The L

Lord, God of vengeance, God of vengeance, shine forth!

Rise up, Judge of the earth, Pay back retribution to the proud.

How long, Lord, shall the wicked— How long shall the wicked triumph?

They pour out words,  they speak arrogantly; All who do injustice boast.

They crush Your people, Lord, And afflict Your inheritance.

They kill the widow and the stranger And murder the orphans.

They have said, “The Lord does not see, Nor does the God of Jacob perceive.”

¶Pay attention, you stupid ones among the people; And when will you understand, foolish ones?

He who planted the ear, does He not hear? Or He who formed the eye, does He not see?

He who disciplines the nations, will He not rebuke, He who teaches mankind knowledge?

The Lord knows human thoughts, That they are mere breath.

¶Blessed is the man whom You discipline, Lord, And whom You teach from Your Law,

So that You may grant him relief from the days of adversity, Until a pit is dug for the wicked.

For the Lord will not abandon His people, Nor will He abandon His inheritance.

For judgment will again be righteous, And all the upright in heart will follow it.

Who will stand up for me against evildoers? Who will take his stand for me against those who do injustice?

¶If the Lord had not been my help, My soul would soon have dwelt in the land of silence.

If I should say, “My foot has slipped,” Your faithfulness, Lord, will support me.

When my anxious thoughts multiply within me, Your comfort delights my soul.

Can a throne of destruction be allied with You, One which devises mischief by decree?

They band themselves together against the life of the righteous And condemn the innocent to death.

But the Lord has been my refuge, And my God the rock of my refuge.

He has brought back their injustice upon them, And He will destroy them in their evil; The Lord our God will destroy them.
