#Childlike Trust in the L

Lord, my heart is not proud, nor my eyes arrogant; Nor do I involve myself in great matters, Or in things too difficult for me.

I have certainly soothed and quieted my soul; Like a weaned child resting against his mother, My soul within me is like a weaned child.

Israel, wait for the Lord From this time on and forever.
