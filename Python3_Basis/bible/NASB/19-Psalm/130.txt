#Hope in the L

Out of the depths I have cried to You, Lord.

Lord, hear my voice! Let Your ears be attentive To the sound of my pleadings.

If You, Lord, were to keep account of guilty deeds, Lord, who could stand?

But there is forgiveness with You, So that You may be revered.

Â¶I wait for the Lord, my soul waits, And I wait for His word.

My soul waits in hope for the Lord More than the watchmen for the morning; Yes, more than the watchmen for the morning.

Israel, wait for the Lord; For with the Lord there is mercy, And with Him is abundant redemption.

And He will redeem Israel From all his guilty deeds.
