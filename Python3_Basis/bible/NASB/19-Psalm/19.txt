#The Works and the Word of God.

The heavens tell of the glory of God; And their expanse declares the work of His hands.

Day to day pours forth speech, And night to night reveals knowledge.

There is no speech, nor are there words; Their voice is not heard.

Their line has gone out into all the earth, And their words to the end of the world. In them He has placed a tent for the sun,

Which is like a groom coming out of his chamber; It rejoices like a strong person to run his course.

Its rising is from one end of the heavens, And its circuit to the other end of them; And there is nothing hidden from its heat.

Â¶The Law of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul; The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.

The precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart; The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.

The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever; The judgments of the Lord are true; they are righteous altogether.

They are more desirable than gold, yes, than much pure gold; Sweeter also than honey and drippings of the honeycomb.

Moreover, Your servant is warned by them; In keeping them there is great reward.

Who can discern his errors? Acquit me of hidden faults.

Also keep Your servant back from presumptuous sins; Let them not rule over me; Then I will be innocent, And I will be blameless of great wrongdoing.

May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart Be acceptable in Your sight, Lord, my rock and my Redeemer.
