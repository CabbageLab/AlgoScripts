#Praise the L

Praise the Lord! Praise the name of the Lord; Praise Him,  you servants of the Lord,

You who stand in the house of the Lord, In the courtyards of the house of our God!

Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good; Sing praises to His name, for it is lovely.

For the Lord has chosen Jacob for Himself, Israel as His own possession.

¶For I know that the Lord is great And that our Lord is above all gods.

Whatever the Lord pleases, He does, In heaven and on earth, in the seas and in all the ocean depths.

He causes the mist to ascend from the ends of the earth, He makes lightning for the rain; He brings forth the wind from His treasuries.

¶He struck the firstborn of Egypt, Both human firstborn and animal.

He sent signs and wonders into your midst, Egypt, Upon Pharaoh and all his servants.

He struck many nations And brought death to mighty kings,

Sihon, king of the Amorites, Og, king of Bashan, And all the kingdoms of Canaan;

And He gave their land as an inheritance, An inheritance to His people Israel.

Your name, Lord, is everlasting, The mention of You, Lord, is throughout all generations.

For the Lord will judge His people And will have compassion on His servants.

The idols of the nations are nothing but silver and gold, The work of human hands.

They have mouths, but they do not speak; They have eyes, but they do not see;

They have ears, but they do not hear, Nor is there any breath at all in their mouths.

Those who make them will become like them, Yes,  everyone who trusts in them.

¶House of Israel, bless the Lord; House of Aaron, bless the Lord;

House of Levi, bless the Lord; You who revere the Lord, bless the Lord.

Blessed be the Lord from Zion, Who dwells in Jerusalem. Praise the Lord!
