#The L

In the Lord I take refuge; How can you say to my soul, “Flee as a bird to your mountain?

“For, behold, the wicked bend the bow, They have set their arrow on the string To shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.

“If the foundations are destroyed, What can the righteous do?”

¶The Lord is in His holy temple; the Lord’s throne is in heaven; His eyes see, His eyelids test the sons of mankind.

The Lord tests the righteous and the wicked, And His soul hates one who loves violence.

He will rain coals of fire upon the wicked, And brimstone and burning wind will be the portion of their cup.

For the Lord is righteous, He loves righteousness; The upright will see His face.
