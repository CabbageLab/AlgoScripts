#Prayer for Help and Guidance.

Hear my prayer, Lord, Listen to my pleadings! Answer me in Your faithfulness, in Your righteousness!

And do not enter into judgment with Your servant, For no person living is righteous in Your sight.

For the enemy has persecuted my soul; He has crushed my life to the ground; He has made me dwell in dark places, like those who have long been dead.

Therefore my spirit feels weak within me; My heart is appalled within me.

¶I remember the days of old; I meditate on all Your accomplishments; I reflect on the work of Your hands.

I spread out my hands to You; My soul longs for You, like a weary land. Selah

¶Answer me quickly, Lord, my spirit fails; Do not hide Your face from me, Or I will be the same as those who go down to the pit.

Let me hear Your faithfulness in the morning, For I trust in You; Teach me the way in which I should walk; For to You I lift up my soul.

Save me, Lord, from my enemies; I take refuge in You.

¶Teach me to do Your will, For You are my God; Let Your good Spirit lead me on level ground.

For the sake of Your name, Lord, revive me. In Your righteousness bring my soul out of trouble.

And in Your faithfulness, destroy my enemies, And eliminate all those who attack my soul, For I am Your servant.
