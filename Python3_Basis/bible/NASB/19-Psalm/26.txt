#Protestation of Integrity and Prayer for Protection.

Vindicate me, Lord, for I have walked in my integrity, And I have trusted in the Lord without wavering.

Examine me, Lord, and put me to the test; Refine my mind and my heart.

For Your goodness is before my eyes, And I have walked in Your truth.

I do not sit with deceitful people, Nor will I go with pretenders.

I hate the assembly of evildoers, And I will not sit with the wicked.

I will wash my hands in innocence, And I will go around Your altar, Lord,

That I may proclaim with the voice of thanksgiving And declare all Your wonders.

Â¶Lord, I love the dwelling of Your house, And the place where Your glory remains.

Do not take my soul away along with sinners, Nor my life with men of bloodshed,

In whose hands is a wicked scheme, And whose right hand is full of bribes.

But as for me, I will walk in my integrity; Redeem me, and be gracious to me.

My foot stands on level ground; In the congregations I will bless the Lord.
