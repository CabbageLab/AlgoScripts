#A Contrite Sinner’s Prayer for Pardon.

Be gracious to me, God, according to Your faithfulness; According to the greatness of Your compassion, wipe out my wrongdoings.

Wash me thoroughly from my guilt And cleanse me from my sin.

For I know my wrongdoings, And my sin is constantly before me.

Against You, You only, I have sinned And done what is evil in Your sight, So that You are justified when You speak And blameless when You judge.

¶Behold, I was brought forth in guilt, And in sin my mother conceived me.

Behold, You desire truth in the innermost being, And in secret You will make wisdom known to me.

Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean; Cleanse me, and I will be whiter than snow.

Let me hear joy and gladness, Let the bones You have broken rejoice.

Hide Your face from my sins And wipe out all my guilty deeds.

¶Create in me a clean heart, God, And renew a steadfast spirit within me.

Do not cast me away from Your presence, And do not take Your Holy Spirit from me.

Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, And sustain me with a willing spirit.

Then I will teach wrongdoers Your ways, And sinners will be converted to You.

¶Save me from the guilt of bloodshed, God, the God of my salvation; Then my tongue will joyfully sing of Your righteousness.

Lord, open my lips, So that my mouth may declare Your praise.

For You do not delight in sacrifice, otherwise I would give it; You do not take pleasure in burnt offering.

The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; A broken and a contrite heart, God, You will not despise.

¶By Your favor do good to Zion; Build the walls of Jerusalem.

Then You will delight in righteous sacrifices, In burnt offering and whole burnt offering; Then bulls will be offered on Your altar.
