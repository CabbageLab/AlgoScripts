#Praise to the L

The Lord reigns, the peoples tremble! He sits enthroned above the cherubim, the earth quakes!

The Lord is great in Zion, And He is exalted above all the peoples.

May they praise Your great and awesome name; Holy is He.

The strength of the King loves justice; You have established order; You have executed justice and righteousness in Jacob.

Exalt the Lord our God And worship at His footstool; Holy is He.

Â¶Moses and Aaron were among His priests, And Samuel was among those who called on His name; They called upon the Lord and He answered them.

He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud; They kept His testimonies And the statute that He gave them.

Lord our God, You answered them; You were a forgiving God to them, And yet an avenger of their evil deeds.

Exalt the Lord our God And worship at His holy hill, For the Lord our God is holy.
