#The L

Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord, my soul!

I will praise the Lord while I live; I will sing praises to my God while I have my being.

Do not trust in noblemen, In mortal man, in whom there is no salvation.

His spirit departs, he returns to the earth; On that very day his plans perish.

Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob, Whose hope is in the Lord his God,

Who made heaven and earth, The sea and everything that is in them; Who keeps faith forever;

Who executes justice for the oppressed; Who gives food to the hungry. The Lord frees the prisoners.

Â¶The Lord opens the eyes of those who are blind; The Lord raises up those who are bowed down; The Lord loves the righteous.

The Lord watches over strangers; He supports the fatherless and the widow, But He thwarts the way of the wicked.

The Lord will reign forever, Your God, Zion, to all generations. Praise the Lord!
