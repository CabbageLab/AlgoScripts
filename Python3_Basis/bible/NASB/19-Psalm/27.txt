#A Psalm of Fearless Trust in God.

The Lord is my light and my salvation; Whom should I fear? The Lord is the defense of my life; Whom should I dread?

When evildoers came upon me to devour my flesh, My adversaries and my enemies, they stumbled and fell.

If an army encamps against me, My heart will not fear; If war arises against me, In spite of this I am confident.

¶One thing I have asked from the Lord, that I shall seek: That I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, To behold the beauty of the Lord And to meditate in His temple.

For on the day of trouble He will conceal me in His tabernacle; He will hide me in the secret place of His tent; He will lift me up on a rock.

And now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me, And I will offer sacrifices in His tent with shouts of joy; I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to the Lord.

¶Hear, Lord, when I cry with my voice, And be gracious to me and answer me.

When You said,  “Seek My face,” my heart said to You, “I shall seek Your face, Lord.”

Do not hide Your face from me, Do not turn Your servant away in anger; You have been my help; Do not abandon me nor forsake me, God of my salvation!

For my father and my mother have forsaken me, But the Lord will take me up.

¶Teach me Your way, Lord, And lead me on a level path Because of my enemies.

Do not turn me over to the desire of my enemies, For false witnesses have risen against me, And the violent witness.

I certainly believed that I would see the goodness of the Lord In the land of the living.

Wait for the Lord; Be strong and let your heart take courage; Yes, wait for the Lord.
