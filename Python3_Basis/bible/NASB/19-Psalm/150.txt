#A Psalm of Praise.

Praise the Lord! Praise God in His sanctuary; Praise Him in His mighty expanse.

Praise Him for His mighty deeds; Praise Him according to His excellent greatness.

Â¶Praise Him with trumpet sound; Praise Him with harp and lyre.

Praise Him with tambourine and dancing; Praise Him with stringed instruments and flute.

Praise Him with loud cymbals; Praise Him with resounding cymbals.

Everything that has breath shall praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!
