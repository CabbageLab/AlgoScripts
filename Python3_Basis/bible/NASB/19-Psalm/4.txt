#Evening Prayer of Trust in God.

Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness! You have relieved me in my distress; Be gracious to me and hear my prayer.

¶You sons of man, how long will my honor be treated as an insult? How long will you love what is worthless and strive for a lie? Selah

But know that the Lord has set apart the godly person for Himself; The Lord hears when I call to Him.

¶Tremble, and do not sin; Meditate in your heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah

Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, And trust in the Lord.

¶Many are saying, “Who will show us anything good?” Lift up the light of Your face upon us, Lord!

You have put joy in my heart, More than when their grain and new wine are abundant.

In peace I will both lie down and sleep, For You alone, Lord, have me dwell in safety.
