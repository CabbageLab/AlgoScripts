#God Alone a Refuge from Treachery and Oppression.

My soul waits in silence for God alone; From Him comes my salvation.

He alone is my rock and my salvation, My stronghold; I will not be greatly shaken.

¶How long will you attack a man, That you may murder him,  all of you, Like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence?

They have planned only to thrust him down from his high position; They delight in falsehood; They bless with their mouth, But inwardly they curse. Selah

¶My soul, wait in silence for God alone, For my hope is from Him.

He alone is my rock and my salvation, My refuge; I will not be shaken.

My salvation and my glory rest on God; The rock of my strength, my refuge is in God.

Trust in Him at all times, you people; Pour out your hearts before Him; God is a refuge for us. Selah

¶People of low standing are only breath, and people of rank are a lie; In the balances they go up. Together they are lighter than breath.

Do not trust in oppression, And do not vainly rely on robbery; If wealth increases, do not set your heart on it.

¶God has spoken once; Twice I have heard this: That power belongs to God;

And faithfulness is Yours, Lord, For You reward a person according to his work.
