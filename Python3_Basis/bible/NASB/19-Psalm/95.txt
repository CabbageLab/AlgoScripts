#Praise to the L

Come, let’s sing for joy to the Lord, Let’s shout joyfully to the rock of our salvation.

Let’s come before His presence with a song of thanksgiving, Let’s shout joyfully to Him in songs with instruments.

For the Lord is a great God And a great King above all gods,

In whose hand are the depths of the earth, The peaks of the mountains are also His.

The sea is His, for it was He who made it, And His hands formed the dry land.

¶Come, let’s worship and bow down, Let’s kneel before the Lord our Maker.

For He is our God, And we are the people of His pasture and the sheep of His hand. Today, if you will hear His voice,

Do not harden your hearts as at Meribah, As on the day of Massah in the wilderness,

“When your fathers put Me to the test, They tested Me, though they had seen My work.

“For forty years I was disgusted with that generation, And said they are a people who err in their heart, And they do not know My ways.

“Therefore I swore in My anger, They certainly shall not enter My rest.”
