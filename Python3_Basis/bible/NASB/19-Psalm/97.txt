#The L

The Lord reigns, may the earth rejoice; May the many islands be joyful.

Clouds and thick darkness surround Him; Righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne.

Fire goes before Him And burns up His enemies all around.

His lightning lit up the world; The earth saw it and trembled.

The mountains melted like wax at the presence of the Lord, At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.

The heavens declare His righteousness, And all the peoples have seen His glory.

¶May all those be ashamed who serve carved images, Who boast in idols; Worship Him, all you gods.

Zion heard this and was joyful, And the daughters of Judah have rejoiced Because of Your judgments, Lord.

For You are the Lord Most High over all the earth; You are exalted far above all gods.

¶Hate evil, you who love the Lord, Who watches over the souls of His godly ones; He saves them from the hand of the wicked.

Light is sown like seed for the righteous, And gladness for the upright in heart.

Be joyful in the Lord, you righteous ones, And praise the mention of His holy name.
