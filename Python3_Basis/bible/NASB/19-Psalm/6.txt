#Prayer for Mercy in Time of Trouble.

Lord, do not rebuke me in Your anger, Nor discipline me in Your wrath.

Be gracious to me, Lord, for I am frail; Heal me, Lord, for my bones are horrified.

And my soul is greatly horrified; But You, Lord—how long?

¶Return, Lord, rescue my soul; Save me because of Your mercy.

For there is no mention of You in death; In Sheol, who will praise You?

¶I am weary with my sighing; Every night I make my bed swim, I flood my couch with my tears.

My eye has wasted away with grief; It has grown old because of all my enemies.

¶Leave me, all you who practice injustice, For the Lord has heard the sound of my weeping.

The Lord has heard my pleading, The Lord receives my prayer.

All my enemies will be put to shame and greatly horrified; They shall turn back, they will suddenly be put to shame.
