#The Futility of Life.

I said, “I will keep watch over my ways So that I do not sin with my tongue; I will keep watch over my mouth as with a muzzle While the wicked are in my presence.”

I was mute and silent, I refused to say even something good, And my pain was stirred up.

My heart was hot within me, While I was musing the fire burned; Then I spoke with my tongue:

“Lord, let me know my end, And what is the extent of my days; Let me know how transient I am.

“Behold, You have made my days like hand widths, And my lifetime as nothing in Your sight; Certainly all mankind standing is a mere breath. Selah

“Certainly every person walks around as a fleeting shadow; They certainly make an uproar for nothing; He amasses riches and does not know who will gather them.

¶“And now, Lord, for what do I wait? My hope is in You.

“Save me from all my wrongdoings; Do not make me an object of reproach for the foolish.

“I have become mute, I do not open my mouth, Because it is You who have done it.

“Remove Your plague from me; Because of the opposition of Your hand I am perishing.

“With rebukes You punish a person for wrongdoing; You consume like a moth what is precious to him; Certainly all mankind is mere breath! Selah

¶“Hear my prayer, Lord, and listen to my cry for help; Do not be silent to my tears; For I am a stranger with You, One who lives abroad, like all my fathers.

“Turn Your eyes away from me, that I may become cheerful again Before I depart and am no more.”
