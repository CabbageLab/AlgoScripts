#The L

I will bless the Lord at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth.

My soul will make its boast in the Lord; The humble will hear it and rejoice.

Exalt the Lord with me, And let’s exalt His name together.

¶I sought the Lord and He answered me, And rescued me from all my fears.

They looked to Him and were radiant, And their faces will never be ashamed.

This wretched man cried out, and the Lord heard him, And saved him out of all his troubles.

The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear Him, And rescues them.

¶Taste and see that the Lord is good; How blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him!

Fear the Lord, you His saints; For to those who fear Him there is no lack of anything.

The young lions do without and suffer hunger; But they who seek the Lord will not lack any good thing.

Come, you children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord.

Who is the person who desires life And loves length of days, that he may see good?

Keep your tongue from evil And your lips from speaking deceit.

Turn from evil and do good; Seek peace and pursue it.

¶The eyes of the Lord are toward the righteous, And His ears are toward their cry for help.

The face of the Lord is against evildoers, To eliminate the memory of them from the earth.

The righteous cry out, and the Lord hears And rescues them from all their troubles.

The Lord is near to the brokenhearted And saves those who are crushed in spirit.

¶The afflictions of the righteous are many, But the Lord rescues him from them all.

He protects all his bones, Not one of them is broken.

Evil will bring death to the wicked, And those who hate the righteous will suffer for their guilt.

The Lord redeems the souls of His servants, And none of those who take refuge in Him will suffer for their guilt.
