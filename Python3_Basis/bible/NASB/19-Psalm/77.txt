#Comfort in Trouble from Recalling God’s Mighty Deeds.

My voice rises to God, and I will cry aloud; My voice rises to God, and He will listen to me.

In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord; In the night my hand was stretched out and did not grow weary; My soul refused to be comforted.

When I remember God, then I am restless; When I sigh, then my spirit feels weak. Selah

You have held my eyelids open; I am so troubled that I cannot speak.

I have considered the days of old, The years of long ago.

I will remember my song in the night; I will meditate with my heart, And my spirit ponders:

¶Will the Lord reject forever? And will He never be favorable again?

Has His favor ceased forever? Has His promise come to an end forever?

Has God forgotten to be gracious, Or has He in anger withdrawn His compassion? Selah

Then I said, “It is my grief, That the right hand of the Most High has changed.”

¶I shall remember the deeds of the Lord; I will certainly remember Your wonders of old.

I will meditate on all Your work, And on Your deeds with thanksgiving.

Your way, God, is holy; What god is great like our God?

You are the God who works wonders; You have made known Your strength among the peoples.

By Your power You have redeemed Your people, The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah

¶The waters saw You, God; The waters saw You, they were in anguish; The ocean depths also trembled.

The clouds poured out water; The skies sounded out; Your arrows flashed here and there.

The sound of Your thunder was in the whirlwind; The lightning lit up the world; The earth trembled and shook.

Your way was in the sea And Your paths in the mighty waters, And Your footprints were not known.

You led Your people like a flock By the hand of Moses and Aaron.
