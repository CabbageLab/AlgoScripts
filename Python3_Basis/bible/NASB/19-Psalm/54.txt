#Prayer for Defense against Enemies.

Save me, God, by Your name, And vindicate me by Your power.

Hear my prayer, God; Listen to the words of my mouth.

For strangers have risen against me And violent men have sought my life; They have not set God before them. Selah

¶Behold, God is my helper; The Lord is the sustainer of my soul.

He will pay back the evil to my enemies; Destroy them in Your faithfulness.

¶Willingly I will sacrifice to You; I will praise Your name, Lord, for it is good.

For He has saved me from all trouble, And my eye has looked with satisfaction upon my enemies.
