The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s.

#The Woman Speaks of Her Lover

W Let him kiss me with kisses of his mouth, for your love is better than wine,

better than the fragrance of your perfumes. Your name is a flowing perfume— therefore young women love you.

Draw me after you! Let us run! The king has brought me to his bed chambers. Let us exult and rejoice in you; let us celebrate your love: it is beyond wine! Rightly do they love you!

#Love’s Boast

W I am black and beautiful, Daughters of Jerusalem— Like the tents of Qedar, like the curtains of Solomon.

Do not stare at me because I am so black, because the sun has burned me. The sons of my mother were angry with me; they charged me with the care of the vineyards: my own vineyard I did not take care of.

#Love’s Inquiry

W Tell me, you whom my soul loves, where you shepherd, where you give rest at midday. Why should I be like one wandering after the flocks of your companions?

M If you do not know, most beautiful among women, Follow the tracks of the flock and pasture your lambs near the shepherds’ tents.

#Love’s Vision

M To a mare among Pharaoh’s chariotry I compare you, my friend:

Your cheeks lovely in pendants, your neck in jewels.

We will make pendants of gold for you, and ornaments of silver.

#How Near Is Love!

W While the king was upon his couch, my spikenard gave forth its fragrance.

My lover is to me a sachet of myrrh; between my breasts he lies.

My lover is to me a cluster of henna from the vineyards of En-gedi.

M How beautiful you are, my friend, how beautiful! your eyes are doves!

W How beautiful you are, my lover— handsome indeed! Verdant indeed is our couch;

the beams of our house are cedars, our rafters, cypresses.
