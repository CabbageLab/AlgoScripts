#Psalm 127

#The Need of God’s Blessing

A song of ascents. Of Solomon. I Unless the Lord build the house, they labor in vain who build. Unless the Lord guard the city, in vain does the guard keep watch.

It is vain for you to rise early and put off your rest at night, To eat bread earned by hard toil— all this God gives to his beloved in sleep.

#II

Certainly sons are a gift from the Lord, the fruit of the womb, a reward.

Like arrows in the hand of a warrior are the sons born in one’s youth.

Blessed is the man who has filled his quiver with them. He will never be shamed for he will destroy his foes at the gate.
