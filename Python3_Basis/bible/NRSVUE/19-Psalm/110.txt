#Psalm 110

#Assurance of Victory for God’s Priest-King

#Of David. A Psalm.

The Lord says to my lord, “Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool.”

The Lord sends out from Zion your mighty scepter. Rule in the midst of your foes.

Your people will offer themselves willingly on the day you lead your forces on the holy mountains. From the womb of the morning, like dew, your youth will come to you.

The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind, “You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.”

The Lord is at your right hand; he will shatter kings on the day of his wrath.

He will execute judgment among the nations, filling them with corpses; he will shatter heads over the wide earth.

He will drink from the stream by the path; therefore he will lift up his head.
