#Psalm 24

#Entrance into the Temple

#Of David. A Psalm.

The earth is the Lordâ€™s and all that is in it, the world, and those who live in it,

for he has founded it on the seas and established it on the rivers.

Who shall ascend the hill of the Lord? And who shall stand in his holy place?

Those who have clean hands and pure hearts, who do not lift up their souls to what is false and do not swear deceitfully.

They will receive blessing from the Lord and vindication from the God of their salvation.

Such is the company of those who seek him, who seek the face of the God of Jacob. Selah

Lift up your heads, O gates! and be lifted up, O ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in!

Who is the King of glory? The Lord, strong and mighty, the Lord, mighty in battle.

Lift up your heads, O gates! and be lifted up, O ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in!

Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah
