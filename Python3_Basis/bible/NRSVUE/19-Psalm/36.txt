#Psalm 36

#Human Wickedness and Divine Goodness

#To the leader. Of David, the servant of the Lord.

Transgression speaks to the wicked deep in their hearts; there is no fear of God before their eyes.

For they flatter themselves in their own eyes that their iniquity cannot be found out and hated.

The words of their mouths are mischief and deceit; they have ceased to act wisely and do good.

They plot mischief while on their beds; they are set on a way that is not good; they do not reject evil.

Your steadfast love, O Lord, extends to the heavens, your faithfulness to the clouds.

Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains; your judgments are like the great deep; you save humans and animals alike, O Lord.

How precious is your steadfast love, O God! All people may take refuge in the shadow of your wings.

They feast on the abundance of your house, and you give them drink from the river of your delights.

For with you is the fountain of life; in your light we see light.

O continue your steadfast love to those who know you and your salvation to the upright of heart!

Do not let the foot of the arrogant tread on me or the hand of the wicked drive me away.

There the evildoers lie prostrate; they are thrust down, unable to rise.
