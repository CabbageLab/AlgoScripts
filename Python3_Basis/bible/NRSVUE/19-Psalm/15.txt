#Psalm 15

#Who Shall Abide in Godâ€™s Sanctuary?

#A Psalm of David.

O Lord, who may abide in your tent? Who may dwell on your holy hill?

Those who walk blamelessly and do what is right and speak the truth from their heart;

who do not slander with their tongue and do no evil to their friends nor heap shame upon their neighbors;

in whose eyes the wicked are despised but who honor those who fear the Lord; who stand by their oath even to their hurt;

who do not lend money at interest and do not take a bribe against the innocent. Those who do these things shall never be moved.
