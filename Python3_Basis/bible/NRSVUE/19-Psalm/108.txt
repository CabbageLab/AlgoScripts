#Psalm 108

#Praise and Prayer for Victory

#A Song. A Psalm of David.

My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast; I will sing and make melody. Awake, my soul!

Awake, O harp and lyre! I will awake the dawn.

I will give thanks to you, O Lord, among the peoples, and I will sing praises to you among the nations.

For your steadfast love is higher than the heavens, and your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.

Be exalted, O God, above the heavens, and let your glory be over all the earth.

Give victory with your right hand, and answer me, so that those whom you love may be rescued.

God has promised in his sanctuary: “With exultation I will divide up Shechem and portion out the Vale of Succoth.

Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet; Judah is my scepter.

Moab is my washbasin; on Edom I hurl my shoe; over Philistia I shout in triumph.”

Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?

Have you not rejected us, O God? You do not go out, O God, with our armies.

O grant us help against the foe, for human help is worthless.

With God we shall do valiantly; it is he who will tread down our foes.
