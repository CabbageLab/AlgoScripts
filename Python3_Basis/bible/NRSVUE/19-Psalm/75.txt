#Psalm 75

#Thanksgiving for God’s Wondrous Deeds

#To the leader: Do Not Destroy. A Psalm of Asaph. A Song.

We give thanks to you, O God; we give thanks; your name is near. People tell of your wondrous deeds.

At the set time that I appoint, I will judge with equity.

When the earth totters, with all its inhabitants, it is I who keep its pillars steady. Selah

I say to the boastful, “Do not boast,” and to the wicked, “Do not lift up your horn;

do not lift up your horn on high or speak with insolent neck.”

For not from the east or from the west and not from the wilderness comes lifting up,

but it is God who executes judgment, putting down one and lifting up another.

For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup with foaming wine, well mixed; he will pour a draught from it, and all the wicked of the earth shall drain it down to the dregs.

But I will rejoice forever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.

All the horns of the wicked I will cut off, but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.
