#Psalm 54

#Prayer for Vindication

#To the leader: with stringed instruments. A Maskil of David, when the Ziphites went and told Saul, “David is in hiding among us.”

Save me, O God, by your name, and vindicate me by your might.

Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.

For the insolent have risen against me; the ruthless seek my life; they do not set God before them. Selah

But surely, God is my helper; the Lord is the upholder of my life.

He will repay my enemies for their evil. In your faithfulness, put an end to them.

With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to you; I will give thanks to your name, O Lord, for it is good.

For he has delivered me from every trouble, and my eye has looked in triumph on my enemies.
