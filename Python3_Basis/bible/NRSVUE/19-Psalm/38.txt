#Psalm 38

#A Penitent Sufferer’s Plea for Healing

#A Psalm of David, for the memorial offering.

O Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.

For your arrows have sunk into me, and your hand has come down on me.

There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation; there is no health in my bones because of my sin.

For my iniquities have gone over my head; they weigh like a burden too heavy for me.

My wounds grow foul and fester because of my foolishness;

I am utterly bowed down and prostrate; all day long I go around mourning.

For my loins are filled with burning, and there is no soundness in my flesh.

I am utterly spent and crushed; I groan because of the tumult of my heart.

O Lord, all my longing is known to you; my sighing is not hidden from you.

My heart throbs; my strength fails me; as for the light of my eyes—it also has gone from me.

My friends and companions stand aloof from my affliction, and my neighbors stand far off.

Those who seek my life lay their snares; those who seek to hurt me speak of ruin and meditate on treachery all day long.

But I am like the deaf; I do not hear; like the mute, who cannot speak.

Truly, I am like one who does not hear and in whose mouth is no retort.

But it is for you, O Lord, that I wait; it is you, O Lord my God, who will answer.

For I pray, “Only do not let them rejoice over me, those who boast against me when my foot slips.”

For I am ready to fall, and my pain is ever with me.

I confess my iniquity; I am sorry for my sin.

Those who are my foes without cause are mighty, and many are those who hate me wrongfully.

Those who render me evil for good are my adversaries because I follow after good.

Do not forsake me, O Lord; O my God, do not be far from me;

make haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation.
