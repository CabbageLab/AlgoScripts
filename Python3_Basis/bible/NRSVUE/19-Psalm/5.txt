#Psalm 5

#Trust in God for Deliverance from Enemies

#To the leader: for the flutes. A Psalm of David.

Listen to my words, O Lord; attend to my sighing.

Listen to the sound of my cry, my King and my God, for to you I pray.

O Lord, in the morning you hear my voice; in the morning I plead my case to you and watch.

For you are not a God who delights in wickedness; evil will not sojourn with you.

The boastful will not stand before your eyes; you hate all evildoers.

You destroy those who speak lies; the Lord abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful.

But I, through the abundance of your steadfast love, will enter your house; I will bow down toward your holy temple in awe of you.

Lead me, O Lord, in your righteousness because of my enemies; make your way straight before me.

For there is no truth in their mouths; their hearts are destruction; their throats are open graves; they flatter with their tongues.

Make them bear their guilt, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; because of their many transgressions, cast them out, for they have rebelled against you.

But let all who take refuge in you rejoice; let them ever sing for joy. Spread your protection over them, so that those who love your name may exult in you.

For you bless the righteous, O Lord; you cover them with favor as with a shield.
