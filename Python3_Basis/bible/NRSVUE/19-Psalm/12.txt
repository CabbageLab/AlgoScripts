#Psalm 12

#Plea for Help in Evil Times

#To the leader: according to The Sheminith. A Psalm of David.

Help, O Lord, for there is no longer anyone who is godly; the faithful have disappeared from humankind.

They utter lies to each other; with flattering lips and a deceitful heart they speak.

May the Lord cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that makes great boasts,

those who say, “With our tongues we will prevail; our lips are our own—who is our master?”

“Because the poor are despoiled, because the needy groan, I will now rise up,” says the Lord; “I will place them in the safety for which they long.”

The promises of the Lord are promises that are pure, silver refined in a furnace on the ground, purified seven times.

You, O Lord, will protect us; you will guard us from this generation forever.

On every side the wicked prowl, as vileness is exalted among humankind.
