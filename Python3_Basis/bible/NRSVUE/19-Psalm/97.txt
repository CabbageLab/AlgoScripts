#Psalm 97

#The Glory of Godâ€™s Reign

The Lord is king! Let the earth rejoice; let the many coastlands be glad!

Clouds and thick darkness are all around him; righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.

Fire goes before him and consumes his adversaries on every side.

His lightnings light up the world; the earth sees and trembles.

The mountains melt like wax before the Lord, before the Lord of all the earth.

The heavens proclaim his righteousness, and all the peoples behold his glory.

All servants of images are put to shame, those who make their boast in worthless idols; all gods bow down before him.

Zion hears and is glad, and the towns of Judah rejoice because of your judgments, O God.

For you, O Lord, are most high over all the earth; you are exalted far above all gods.

You who love the Lord, hate evil; he guards the lives of his faithful; he rescues them from the hand of the wicked.

Light dawns for the righteous and joy for the upright in heart.

Rejoice in the Lord, O you righteous, and give thanks to his holy name!
