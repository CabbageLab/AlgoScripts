#Psalm 70

#Prayer for Deliverance from Enemies

#To the leader. Of David, for the memorial offering.

Be pleased, O God, to deliver me. O Lord, make haste to help me!

Let those be put to shame and confusion who seek my life. Let those be turned back and brought to dishonor who desire to hurt me.

Let those who say, “Aha, Aha!” turn back because of their shame.

Let all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you. Let those who love your salvation say evermore, “God is great!”

But I am poor and needy; hasten to me, O God! You are my help and my deliverer; O Lord, do not delay!
