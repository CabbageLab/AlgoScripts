#Psalm 135

#Praise for God’s Goodness and Might

Praise the Lord! Praise the name of the Lord; give praise, O servants of the Lord,

you who stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God.

Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good; sing to his name, for he is gracious.

For the Lord has chosen Jacob for himself, Israel as his own possession.

For I know that the Lord is great; our Lord is above all gods.

Whatever the Lord pleases he does, in heaven and on earth, in the seas and all deeps.

He it is who makes the clouds rise at the end of the earth; he makes lightnings for the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses.

He it was who struck down the firstborn of Egypt, both humans and animals;

he sent signs and wonders into your midst, O Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his servants.

He struck down many nations and killed mighty kings—

Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan—

and gave their land as a heritage, a heritage to his people Israel.

Your name, O Lord, endures forever, your renown, O Lord, throughout all ages.

For the Lord will vindicate his people and have compassion on his servants.

The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of human hands.

They have mouths, but they do not speak; they have eyes, but they do not see;

they have ears, but they do not hear, a nose, but there is no breath in their mouths.

Those who make them and all who trust them shall become like them.

O house of Israel, bless the Lord! O house of Aaron, bless the Lord!

O house of Levi, bless the Lord! You who fear the Lord, bless the Lord!

Blessed be the Lord from Zion, he who resides in Jerusalem. Praise the Lord!
