#Psalm 125

#The Security of Godâ€™s People

#A Song of Ascents.

Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved but abides forever.

As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the Lord surrounds his people from this time on and forevermore.

For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest on the land allotted to the righteous, so that the righteous might not stretch out their hands to do wrong.

Do good, O Lord, to those who are good and to those who are upright in their hearts.

But those who turn aside to their own crooked ways, the Lord will lead away with evildoers. Peace be upon Israel!
