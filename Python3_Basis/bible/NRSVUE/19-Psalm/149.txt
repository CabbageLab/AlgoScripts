#Psalm 149

#Praise for Godâ€™s Goodness to Israel

Praise the Lord! Sing to the Lord a new song, his praise in the assembly of the faithful.

Let Israel be glad in its Maker; let the children of Zion rejoice in their King.

Let them praise his name with dancing, making melody to him with tambourine and lyre.

For the Lord takes pleasure in his people; he adorns the humble with victory.

Let the faithful exult in glory; let them sing for joy on their couches.

Let the high praises of God be in their throats and two-edged swords in their hands,

to execute vengeance on the nations and punishment on the peoples,

to bind their kings with fetters and their nobles with chains of iron,

to execute on them the judgment decreed. This is glory for all his faithful ones. Praise the Lord!
