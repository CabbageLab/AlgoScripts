#Psalm 46

#God’s Defense of His City and People

#To the leader. Of the Korahites. According to Alamoth. A Song.

God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.

Therefore we will not fear, though the earth should change, though the mountains shake in the heart of the sea,

though its waters roar and foam, though the mountains tremble with its tumult. Selah

There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy habitation of the Most High.

God is in the midst of the city; it shall not be moved; God will help it when the morning dawns.

The nations are in an uproar; the kingdoms totter; he utters his voice; the earth melts.

The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah

Come, behold the works of the Lord; see what desolations he has brought on the earth.

He makes wars cease to the end of the earth; he breaks the bow and shatters the spear; he burns the shields with fire.

“Be still, and know that I am God! I am exalted among the nations; I am exalted in the earth.”

The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah
