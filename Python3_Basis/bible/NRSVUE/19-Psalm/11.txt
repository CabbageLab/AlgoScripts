#Psalm 11

#Song of Trust in God

#To the leader. Of David.

In the Lord I take refuge; how can you say to me, “Flee like a bird to the mountains,

for look, the wicked bend the bow, they have fitted their arrow to the string, to shoot in the dark at the upright in heart.

If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?”

The Lord is in his holy temple; the Lord’s throne is in heaven. His eyes behold; his gaze examines humankind.

The Lord tests the righteous and the wicked, and his soul hates the lover of violence.

On the wicked he will rain coals of fire and sulfur; a scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.

For the Lord is righteous; he loves righteous deeds; the upright shall behold his face.
