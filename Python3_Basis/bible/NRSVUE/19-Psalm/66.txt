#Psalm 66

#Praise for God’s Goodness to Israel

#To the leader. A Song. A Psalm.

Make a joyful noise to God, all the earth;

sing the glory of his name; give to him glorious praise.

Say to God, “How awesome are your deeds! Because of your great power, your enemies cringe before you.

All the earth worships you; they sing praises to you, sing praises to your name.” Selah

Come and see what God has done: he is awesome in his deeds among mortals.

He turned the sea into dry land; they passed through the river on foot. There we rejoiced in him,

who rules by his might forever, whose eyes keep watch on the nations— let the rebellious not exalt themselves. Selah

Bless our God, O peoples; let the sound of his praise be heard,

who has kept us among the living and has not let our feet slip.

For you, O God, have tested us; you have tried us as silver is tried.

You brought us into the net; you laid burdens on our backs;

you let people ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water; yet you have brought us out to a spacious place.

I will come into your house with burnt offerings; I will pay you my vows,

those that my lips uttered and my mouth promised when I was in trouble.

I will offer to you burnt offerings of fatted calves, with the smoke of the sacrifice of rams; I will make an offering of bulls and goats. Selah

Come and hear, all you who fear God, and I will tell what he has done for me.

I cried aloud to him, and he was extolled with my tongue.

If I had cherished iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not have listened.

But truly God has listened; he has heard the words of my prayer.

Blessed be God, who has not rejected my prayer or removed his steadfast love from me.
