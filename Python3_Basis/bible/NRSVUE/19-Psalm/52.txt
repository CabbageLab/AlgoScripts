#Psalm 52

#Judgment on the Deceitful

#To the leader. A Maskil of David, when Doeg the Edomite came to Saul and said to him, “David has come to the house of Ahimelech.”

Why do you boast, O mighty one, of mischief done against the godly? All day long

you are plotting destruction. Your tongue is like a sharp razor, you worker of treachery.

You love evil more than good and lying more than speaking the truth. Selah

You love all words that devour, O deceitful tongue.

But God will break you down forever; he will snatch and tear you from your tent; he will uproot you from the land of the living. Selah

The righteous will see and fear and will laugh at the evildoer, saying,

“See the one who would not take refuge in God but trusted in abundant riches and sought refuge in wealth!”

But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God. I trust in the steadfast love of God forever and ever.

I will thank you forever because of what you have done. In the presence of the faithful I will proclaim your name, for it is good.
