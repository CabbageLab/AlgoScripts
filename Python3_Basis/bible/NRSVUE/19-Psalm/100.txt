#Psalm 100

#All Lands Summoned to Praise God

#A Psalm of thanksgiving.

Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth.

Serve the Lord with gladness; come into his presence with singing.

Know that the Lord is God. It is he who made us, and we are his; we are his people and the sheep of his pasture.

Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise. Give thanks to him; bless his name.

For the Lord is good; his steadfast love endures forever and his faithfulness to all generations.
