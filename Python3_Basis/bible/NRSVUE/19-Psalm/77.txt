#Psalm 77

#God’s Mighty Deeds Recalled

#To the leader: according to Jeduthun. Of Asaph. A Psalm.

I cry aloud to God, aloud to God, that he may hear me.

In the day of my trouble I seek the Lord; in the night my hand is stretched out without wearying; my soul refuses to be comforted.

I think of God, and I moan; I meditate, and my spirit faints. Selah

You keep my eyelids from closing; I am so troubled that I cannot speak.

I consider the days of old and remember the years of long ago.

I commune with my heart in the night; I meditate and search my spirit:

“Will the Lord spurn forever and never again be favorable?

Has his steadfast love ceased forever? Are his promises at an end for all time?

Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has he in anger shut up his compassion?” Selah

And I say, “It is my grief that the right hand of the Most High has changed.”

I will call to mind the deeds of the Lord; I will remember your wonders of old.

I will meditate on all your work and muse on your mighty deeds.

Your way, O God, is holy. What god is so great as our God?

You are the God who works wonders; you have displayed your might among the peoples.

With your strong arm you redeemed your people, the descendants of Jacob and Joseph. Selah

When the waters saw you, O God, when the waters saw you, they were afraid; the very deep trembled.

The clouds poured out water; the skies thundered; your arrows flashed on every side.

The crash of your thunder was in the whirlwind; your lightnings lit up the world; the earth trembled and shook.

Your way was through the sea, your path through the mighty waters, yet your footprints were unseen.

You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
