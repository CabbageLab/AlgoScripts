#The Glory and Strength of Zion

Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised in the city of our God. His holy mountain,

beautiful in elevation, is the joy of all the earth, Mount Zion, in the far north, the city of the great King.

Within its citadels God has shown himself a sure defense.

Then the kings assembled, they came on together.

As soon as they saw it, they were astounded; they were in panic, they took to flight;

trembling took hold of them there, pains as of a woman in labor,

as when an east wind shatters the ships of Tarshish.

As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God, which God establishes forever. Selah

We ponder your steadfast love, O God, in the midst of your temple.

Your name, O God, like your praise, reaches to the ends of the earth. Your right hand is filled with victory.

Let Mount Zion be glad, let the towns of Judah rejoice because of your judgments.

Walk about Zion, go all around it, count its towers,

consider well its ramparts; go through its citadels, that you may tell the next generation

that this is God, our God forever and ever. He will be our guide forever.
