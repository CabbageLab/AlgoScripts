#Prayer for Deliverance from Enemies

Deliver me, O Lord, from evildoers; protect me from those who are violent,

who plan evil things in their minds and stir up wars continually.

They make their tongue sharp as a snake's, and under their lips is the venom of vipers. Selah

Guard me, O Lord, from the hands of the wicked; protect me from the violent who have planned my downfall.

The arrogant have hidden a trap for me, and with cords they have spread a net, along the road they have set snares for me. Selah

I say to the Lord, “You are my God; give ear, O Lord, to the voice of my supplications.”

O Lord, my Lord, my strong deliverer, you have covered my head in the day of battle.

Do not grant, O Lord, the desires of the wicked; do not further their evil plot.  Selah

Those who surround me lift up their heads; let the mischief of their lips overwhelm them!

Let burning coals fall on them! Let them be flung into pits, no more to rise!

Do not let the slanderer be established in the land; let evil speedily hunt down the violent!

I know that the Lord maintains the cause of the needy, and executes justice for the poor.

Surely the righteous shall give thanks to your name; the upright shall live in your presence.
