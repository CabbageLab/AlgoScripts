#Praise and Assurance under Persecution

Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me, for in you my soul takes refuge; in the shadow of your wings I will take refuge, until the destroying storms pass by.

I cry to God Most High, to God who fulfills his purpose for me.

He will send from heaven and save me, he will put to shame those who trample on me. Selah God will send forth his steadfast love and his faithfulness.

I lie down among lions that greedily devour human prey; their teeth are spears and arrows, their tongues sharp swords.

Be exalted, O God, above the heavens. Let your glory be over all the earth.

They set a net for my steps; my soul was bowed down. They dug a pit in my path, but they have fallen into it themselves. Selah

My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast. I will sing and make melody.

Awake, my soul! Awake, O harp and lyre! I will awake the dawn.

I will give thanks to you, O Lord, among the peoples; I will sing praises to you among the nations.

For your steadfast love is as high as the heavens; your faithfulness extends to the clouds.

Be exalted, O God, above the heavens. Let your glory be over all the earth.
