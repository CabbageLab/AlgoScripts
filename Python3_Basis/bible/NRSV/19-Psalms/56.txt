#Trust in God under Persecution

Be gracious to me, O God, for people trample on me; all day long foes oppress me;

my enemies trample on me all day long, for many fight against me. O Most High,

when I am afraid, I put my trust in you.

In God, whose word I praise, in God I trust; I am not afraid; what can flesh do to me?

All day long they seek to injure my cause; all their thoughts are against me for evil.

They stir up strife, they lurk, they watch my steps. As they hoped to have my life,

so repay them for their crime; in wrath cast down the peoples, O God!

You have kept count of my tossings; put my tears in your bottle. Are they not in your record?

Then my enemies will retreat in the day when I call. This I know, that God is for me.

In God, whose word I praise, in the Lord, whose word I praise,

in God I trust; I am not afraid. What can a mere mortal do to me?

My vows to you I must perform, O God; I will render thank offerings to you.

For you have delivered my soul from death, and my feet from falling, so that I may walk before God in the light of life.
