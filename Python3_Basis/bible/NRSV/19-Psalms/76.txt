#Israel's Godâ€”Judge of All the Earth

In Judah God is known, his name is great in Israel.

His abode has been established in Salem, his dwelling place in Zion.

There he broke the flashing arrows, the shield, the sword, and the weapons of war. Selah

Glorious are you, more majestic than the everlasting mountains.

The stouthearted were stripped of their spoil; they sank into sleep; none of the troops was able to lift a hand.

At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both rider and horse lay stunned.

But you indeed are awesome! Who can stand before you when once your anger is roused?

From the heavens you uttered judgment; the earth feared and was still

when God rose up to establish judgment, to save all the oppressed of the earth. Selah

Human wrath serves only to praise you, when you bind the last bit of your wrath around you.

Make vows to the Lord your God, and perform them; let all who are around him bring gifts to the one who is awesome,

who cuts off the spirit of princes, who inspires fear in the kings of the earth.
