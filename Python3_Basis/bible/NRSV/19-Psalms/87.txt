#The Joy of Living in Zion

On the holy mount stands the city he founded;

the Lord loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.

Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God. Selah

Among those who know me I mention Rahab and Babylon; Philistia too, and Tyre, with Ethiopia — “This one was born there,” they say.

And of Zion it shall be said, “This one and that one were born in it”; for the Most High himself will establish it.

The Lord records, as he registers the peoples, “This one was born there.” Selah

Singers and dancers alike say, “All my springs are in you.”
