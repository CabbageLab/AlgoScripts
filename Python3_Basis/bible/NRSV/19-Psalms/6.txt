#Prayer for Recovery from Grave Illness

O Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger, or discipline me in your wrath.

Be gracious to me, O Lord, for I am languishing; O Lord, heal me, for my bones are shaking with terror.

My soul also is struck with terror, while you, O Lordâ€”how long?

Turn, O Lord, save my life; deliver me for the sake of your steadfast love.

For in death there is no remembrance of you; in Sheol who can give you praise?

I am weary with my moaning; every night I flood my bed with tears; I drench my couch with my weeping.

My eyes waste away because of grief; they grow weak because of all my foes.

Depart from me, all you workers of evil, for the Lord has heard the sound of my weeping.

The Lord has heard my supplication; the Lord accepts my prayer.

All my enemies shall be ashamed and struck with terror; they shall turn back, and in a moment be put to shame.
