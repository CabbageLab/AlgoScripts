#Prayer for Deliverance from Slanderers

In my distress I cry to the Lord, that he may answer me:

“Deliver me, O Lord, from lying lips, from a deceitful tongue.”

What shall be given to you? And what more shall be done to you, you deceitful tongue?

A warrior's sharp arrows, with glowing coals of the broom tree!

Woe is me, that I am an alien in Meshech, that I must live among the tents of Kedar.

Too long have I had my dwelling among those who hate peace.

I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war.
