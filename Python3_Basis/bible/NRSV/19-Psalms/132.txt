#The Eternal Dwelling of God in Zion

O Lord, remember in David's favor all the hardships he endured;

how he swore to the Lord and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob,

“I will not enter my house or get into my bed;

I will not give sleep to my eyes or slumber to my eyelids,

until I find a place for the Lord, a dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob.”

We heard of it in Ephrathah; we found it in the fields of Jaar.

“Let us go to his dwelling place; let us worship at his footstool.”

Rise up, O Lord, and go to your resting place, you and the ark of your might.

Let your priests be clothed with righteousness, and let your faithful shout for joy.

For your servant David's sake do not turn away the face of your anointed one.

The Lord swore to David a sure oath from which he will not turn back: “One of the sons of your body I will set on your throne.

If your sons keep my covenant and my decrees that I shall teach them, their sons also, forevermore, shall sit on your throne.”

For the Lord has chosen Zion; he has desired it for his habitation:

“This is my resting place forever; here I will reside, for I have desired it.

I will abundantly bless its provisions; I will satisfy its poor with bread.

Its priests I will clothe with salvation, and its faithful will shout for joy.

There I will cause a horn to sprout up for David; I have prepared a lamp for my anointed one.

His enemies I will clothe with disgrace, but on him, his crown will gleam.”
