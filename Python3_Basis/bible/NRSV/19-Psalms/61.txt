#Assurance of God's Protection

Hear my cry, O God; listen to my prayer.

From the end of the earth I call to you, when my heart is faint. Lead me to the rock that is higher than I;

for you are my refuge, a strong tower against the enemy.

Let me abide in your tent forever, find refuge under the shelter of your wings. Selah

For you, O God, have heard my vows; you have given me the heritage of those who fear your name.

Prolong the life of the king; may his years endure to all generations!

May he be enthroned forever before God; appoint steadfast love and faithfulness to watch over him!

So I will always sing praises to your name, as I pay my vows day after day.
