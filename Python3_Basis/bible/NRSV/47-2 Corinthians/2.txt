#Forgiveness for the Offender

But if anyone has caused pain, he has caused it not to me, but to some extent—not to exaggerate it—to all of you.

This punishment by the majority is enough for such a person;

so now instead you should forgive and console him, so that he may not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.

So I urge you to reaffirm your love for him.

I wrote for this reason: to test you and to know whether you are obedient in everything.

Anyone whom you forgive, I also forgive. What I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the presence of Christ.

And we do this so that we may not be outwitted by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his designs.

#Paul's Anxiety in Troas

When I came to Troas to proclaim the good news of Christ, a door was opened for me in the Lord;

but my mind could not rest because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I said farewell to them and went on to Macedonia.

But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumphal procession, and through us spreads in every place the fragrance that comes from knowing him.

For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing;

to the one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things?

For we are not peddlers of God's word like so many;  but in Christ we speak as persons of sincerity, as persons sent from God and standing in his presence.
