1. “Genealogy” (NIV) vs. “Generation” (KJV): 
• NIV uses “genealogy,” which clearly refers to a record of ancestry or lineage. 
• KJV uses “generation,” which, in the context of this verse, refers to the lineage or descent of Jesus Christ, but the term “generation” can also have broader meanings, like the origin or creation of a group. 
2. “Jesus the Messiah” (NIV) vs. “Jesus Christ” (KJV): • NIV calls Him “Jesus the Messiah,” using “Messiah” to emphasize the anointed one or the Savior, which aligns with the Hebrew understanding of “Messiah” (meaning “the Anointed One”). 
• KJV uses “Jesus Christ,” where “Christ” is the Greek term for the same concept (meaning “the Anointed One”). 
3. “Son of David, the son of Abraham” (Both): 
• Both versions maintain the same structure for the titles of Jesus as “the son of David” and “the son of Abraham,” emphasizing Jesus’ descent from two key figures in Jewish history: David (the king) and Abraham (the patriarch).
