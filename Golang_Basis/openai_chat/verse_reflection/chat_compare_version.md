## Format
1. Verse 1: “The Word was God”
   • KJV: “The Word was God” is the same in NIV and ESV, but in the KJV, the phrase has a majestic, formal tone with the older language style. This gives the verse a more weighty, poetic feel compared to the more direct and modern phrasing of the NIV (“the Word was God”) or the ESV (“the Word was God”).
   • NIV/ESV use “He” in verse 2, which is more personal and immediate, while the KJV uses “The same,” which is more indirect, giving a slightly more formal or theological touch.

2. Verse 2: “The same” vs “He”
   • KJV: “The same was in the beginning with God.”
   • The KJV uses “The same” to refer to the Word, which is somewhat more formal and focuses on the consistency of the Word.
   • NIV/ESV: “He was with God in the beginning.”
   • NIV/ESV are more straightforward, directly assigning a personhood to the Word through “He,” which makes it a bit more relational and easy to understand for modern readers.

3. Verse 3: “Made by him” vs. “Made through him”
   • KJV: “All things were made by him” uses the older “by” to describe the agency of the Word in creation. While accurate, the KJV can sound a bit more archaic, and the usage of “by” can be interpreted more literally.
   • NIV: “Through him all things were made” conveys the idea that the Word is the means of creation rather than a direct agent. This phrasing is more consistent with modern understanding of creation in Christian theology.
   • ESV: “All things were made through him” is the same as the NIV, using “through” to clarify the role of the Word in creation, emphasizing the Word as the channel through which everything was made.
