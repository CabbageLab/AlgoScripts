<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou art my strength.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies' sake.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Blessed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD.
