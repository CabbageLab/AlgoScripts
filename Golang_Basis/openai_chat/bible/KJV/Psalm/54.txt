<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O LORD; for it is good.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies.
