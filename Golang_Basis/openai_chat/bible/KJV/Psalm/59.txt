<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to help me, and behold.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their lips: for who, say they, doth hear?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is my defence.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying which they speak.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence, and the God of my mercy.
