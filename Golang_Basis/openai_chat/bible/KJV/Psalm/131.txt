<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> LORD, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.
