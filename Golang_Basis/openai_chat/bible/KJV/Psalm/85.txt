<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> LORD, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way of his steps.
