<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.
