<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD our God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.
