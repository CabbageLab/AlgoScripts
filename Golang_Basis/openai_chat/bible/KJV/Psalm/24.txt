<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> The earth is the LORD'S, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in his holy place?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah.
