<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the mountain of his holiness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> God is known in her palaces for a refuge.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and hasted away.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in travail.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.
