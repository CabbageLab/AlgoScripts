<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all their coasts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>41</bmstyle> He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>42</bmstyle> For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>43</bmstyle> And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>44</bmstyle> And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>45</bmstyle> That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD.
