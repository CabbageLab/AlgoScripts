<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.
