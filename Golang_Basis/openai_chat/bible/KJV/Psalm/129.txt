<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.
