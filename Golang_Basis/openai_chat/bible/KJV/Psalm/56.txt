<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that fight against me, O thou most High.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against me for evil.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the people, O God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: are they not in thy book?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know; for God is for me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his word.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?
