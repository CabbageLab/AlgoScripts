<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song of the drunkards.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.
