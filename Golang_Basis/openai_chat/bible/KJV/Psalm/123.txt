<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.
