<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast scattered us among the heathen.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy wealth by their price.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.
