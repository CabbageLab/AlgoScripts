<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so will we sing and praise thy power.
