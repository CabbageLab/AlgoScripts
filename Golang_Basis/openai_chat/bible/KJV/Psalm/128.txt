<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his ways.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon Israel.
