<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.
