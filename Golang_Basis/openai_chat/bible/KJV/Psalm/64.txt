<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.
