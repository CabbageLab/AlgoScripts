<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.
