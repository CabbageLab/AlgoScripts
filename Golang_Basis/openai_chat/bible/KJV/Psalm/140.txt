<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the violent man;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are they gathered together for war.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders' poison is under their lips. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my supplications, O LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his wicked device; lest they exalt themselves. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and the right of the poor.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence.
