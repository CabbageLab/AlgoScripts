<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will ye be wise?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of thy law;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall cut them off.
