<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understood not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked in their own counsels.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.
