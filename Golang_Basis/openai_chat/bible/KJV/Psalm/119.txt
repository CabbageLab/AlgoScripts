<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> ALEPH. Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him with the whole heart.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> BETH. Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> GIMEL. Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep thy word.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> I am a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all times.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from thy commandments.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> DALETH. My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to thy word.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy statutes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk of thy wondrous works.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto thy word.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law graciously.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid before me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to shame.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> HE. Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it unto the end.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I delight.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me in thy way.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are good.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy righteousness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>41</bmstyle> VAU. Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation, according to thy word.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>42</bmstyle> So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>43</bmstyle> And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>44</bmstyle> So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>45</bmstyle> And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>46</bmstyle> I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>47</bmstyle> And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>48</bmstyle> My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>49</bmstyle> ZAIN. Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>50</bmstyle> This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath quickened me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>51</bmstyle> The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not declined from thy law.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>52</bmstyle> I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted myself.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>53</bmstyle> Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>54</bmstyle> Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>55</bmstyle> I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept thy law.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>56</bmstyle> This I had, because I kept thy precepts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>57</bmstyle> CHETH. Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy words.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>58</bmstyle> I intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto me according to thy word.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>59</bmstyle> I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>60</bmstyle> I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>61</bmstyle> The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not forgotten thy law.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>62</bmstyle> At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>63</bmstyle> I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>64</bmstyle> The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>65</bmstyle> TETH. Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto thy word.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>66</bmstyle> Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>67</bmstyle> Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>68</bmstyle> Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>69</bmstyle> The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>70</bmstyle> Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>71</bmstyle> It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>72</bmstyle> The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>73</bmstyle> JOD. Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>74</bmstyle> They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>75</bmstyle> I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>76</bmstyle> Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>77</bmstyle> Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law is my delight.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>78</bmstyle> Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>79</bmstyle> Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>80</bmstyle> Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>81</bmstyle> CAPH. My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>82</bmstyle> Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>83</bmstyle> For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not forget thy statutes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>84</bmstyle> How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>85</bmstyle> The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy law.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>86</bmstyle> All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>87</bmstyle> They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>88</bmstyle> Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>89</bmstyle> LAMED. For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>90</bmstyle> Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>91</bmstyle> They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all are thy servants.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>92</bmstyle> Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>93</bmstyle> I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>94</bmstyle> I am thine, save me; for I have sought thy precepts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>95</bmstyle> The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will consider thy testimonies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>96</bmstyle> I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is exceeding broad.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>97</bmstyle> MEM. O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>98</bmstyle> Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>99</bmstyle> I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>100</bmstyle> I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>101</bmstyle> I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>102</bmstyle> I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>103</bmstyle> How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>104</bmstyle> Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>105</bmstyle> NUN. Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>106</bmstyle> I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>107</bmstyle> I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto thy word.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>108</bmstyle> Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me thy judgments.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>109</bmstyle> My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>110</bmstyle> The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>111</bmstyle> Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>112</bmstyle> I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even unto the end.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>113</bmstyle> SAMECH. I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>114</bmstyle> Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>115</bmstyle> Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>116</bmstyle> Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>117</bmstyle> Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>118</bmstyle> Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit is falsehood.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>119</bmstyle> Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross: therefore I love thy testimonies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>120</bmstyle> My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>121</bmstyle> AIN. I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>122</bmstyle> Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>123</bmstyle> Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>124</bmstyle> Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>125</bmstyle> I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>126</bmstyle> It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made void thy law.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>127</bmstyle> Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>128</bmstyle> Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false way.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>129</bmstyle> PE. Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>130</bmstyle> The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>131</bmstyle> I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>132</bmstyle> Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>133</bmstyle> Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>134</bmstyle> Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy precepts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>135</bmstyle> Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>136</bmstyle> Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>137</bmstyle> TZADDI. Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>138</bmstyle> Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and very faithful.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>139</bmstyle> My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy words.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>140</bmstyle> Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>141</bmstyle> I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>142</bmstyle> Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>143</bmstyle> Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy commandments are my delights.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>144</bmstyle> The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me understanding, and I shall live.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>145</bmstyle> KOPH. I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy statutes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>146</bmstyle> I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>147</bmstyle> I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>148</bmstyle> Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>149</bmstyle> Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD, quicken me according to thy judgment.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>150</bmstyle> They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from thy law.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>151</bmstyle> Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy commandments are truth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>152</bmstyle> Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>153</bmstyle> RESH. Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy law.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>154</bmstyle> Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy word.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>155</bmstyle> Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy statutes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>156</bmstyle> Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to thy judgments.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>157</bmstyle> Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not decline from thy testimonies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>158</bmstyle> I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept not thy word.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>159</bmstyle> Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD, according to thy lovingkindness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>160</bmstyle> Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>161</bmstyle> SCHIN. Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy word.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>162</bmstyle> I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>163</bmstyle> I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>164</bmstyle> Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>165</bmstyle> Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>166</bmstyle> LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy commandments.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>167</bmstyle> My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them exceedingly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>168</bmstyle> I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways are before thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>169</bmstyle> TAU. Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me understanding according to thy word.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>170</bmstyle> Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to thy word.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>171</bmstyle> My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>172</bmstyle> My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments are righteousness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>173</bmstyle> Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>174</bmstyle> I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law is my delight.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>175</bmstyle> Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy judgments help me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>176</bmstyle> I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments.
