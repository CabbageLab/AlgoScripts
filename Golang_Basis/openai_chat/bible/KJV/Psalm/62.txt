<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall not be moved.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work.
