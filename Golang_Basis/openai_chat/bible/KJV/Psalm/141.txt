<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> LORD, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> But mine eyes are unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.
