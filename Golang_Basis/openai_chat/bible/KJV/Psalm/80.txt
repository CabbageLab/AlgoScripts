<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come and save us.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
