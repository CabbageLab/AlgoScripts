<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto prayer.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Let his days be few; and let another take his office.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake: because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me they shaked their heads.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast done it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul.
