<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is gracious and full of compassion.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for ever.
