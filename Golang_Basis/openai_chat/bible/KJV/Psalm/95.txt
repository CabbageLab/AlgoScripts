<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills is his also.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD our maker.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.
