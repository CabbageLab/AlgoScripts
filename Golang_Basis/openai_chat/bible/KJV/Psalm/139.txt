<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.
