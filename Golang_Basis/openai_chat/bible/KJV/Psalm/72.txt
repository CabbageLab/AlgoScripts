<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king's son.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers that water the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; and daily shall he be praised.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
