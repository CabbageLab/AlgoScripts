<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
