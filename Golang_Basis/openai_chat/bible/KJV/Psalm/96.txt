<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made the heavens.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.
