<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me speedily.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad against me are sworn against me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all generations.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.
