<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to be wise, and to do good.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not good; he abhorreth not evil.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments are a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise.
