<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful together

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity.
