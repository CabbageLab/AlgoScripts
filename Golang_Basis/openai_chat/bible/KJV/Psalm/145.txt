<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness is unsearchable.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I will declare thy greatness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD; and thy saints shall bless thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that be bowed down.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat in due season.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> The LORD is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> The LORD preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.
