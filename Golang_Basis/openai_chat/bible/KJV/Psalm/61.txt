<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Thou wilt prolong the king's life: and his years as many generations.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.
