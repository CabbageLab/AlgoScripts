<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.
