<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the LORD his God:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keepeth truth for ever:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food to the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind: the LORD raiseth them that are bowed down: the LORD loveth the righteous:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> The LORD shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the LORD.
