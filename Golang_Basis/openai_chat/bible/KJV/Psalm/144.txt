<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Blessed be the LORD my strength, which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the son of man, that thou makest account of him!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth away.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store: that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our streets.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is that people, whose God is the LORD.
