<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
