<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fall under thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord; and worship thou him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> The king's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king's palace.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.
