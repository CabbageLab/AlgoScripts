<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth.
