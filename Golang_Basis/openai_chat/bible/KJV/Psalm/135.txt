<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise him, O ye servants of the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above all gods.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that trusteth in them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of Aaron:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.
