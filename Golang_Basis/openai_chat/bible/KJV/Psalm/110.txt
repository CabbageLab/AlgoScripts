<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.
