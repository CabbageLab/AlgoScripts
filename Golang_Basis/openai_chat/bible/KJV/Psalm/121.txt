<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.
