<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your children.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD'S: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the LORD.
