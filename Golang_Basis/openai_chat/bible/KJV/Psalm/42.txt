<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the daytime, and in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my life.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.
