<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> A Song of degrees. LORD, remember David, and all his afflictions:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.
