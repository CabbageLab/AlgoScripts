<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD, that delighteth greatly in his commandments.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth for ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with discretion.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his desire upon his enemies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.
