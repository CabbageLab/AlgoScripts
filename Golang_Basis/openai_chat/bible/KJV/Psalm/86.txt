<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me.
