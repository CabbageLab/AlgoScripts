<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which sing among the branches.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for the conies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.
