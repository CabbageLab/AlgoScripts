<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is good; lead me into the land of uprightness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake: for thy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant.
