<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.
