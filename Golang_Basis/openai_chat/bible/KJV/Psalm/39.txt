<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: then spake I with my tongue,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is; that I may know how frail I am.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age is as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man is vanity. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.
