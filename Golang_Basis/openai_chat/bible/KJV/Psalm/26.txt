<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O LORD:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD.
