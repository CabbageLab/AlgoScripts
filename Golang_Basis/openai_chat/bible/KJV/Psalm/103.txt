<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.
