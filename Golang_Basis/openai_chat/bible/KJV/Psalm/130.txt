<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
