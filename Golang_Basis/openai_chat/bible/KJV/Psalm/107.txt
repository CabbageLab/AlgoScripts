<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits' end.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>41</bmstyle> Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>42</bmstyle> The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>43</bmstyle> Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.
