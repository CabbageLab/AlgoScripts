<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is his refuge.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
