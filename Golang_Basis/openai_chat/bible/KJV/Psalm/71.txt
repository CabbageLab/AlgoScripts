<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline thine ear unto me, and save me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art my rock and my fortress.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from my youth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me out of my mother's bowels: my praise shall be continually of thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all the day.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for there is none to deliver him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Now also when I am old and grayheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to every one that is to come.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done great things: O God, who is like unto thee!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.
