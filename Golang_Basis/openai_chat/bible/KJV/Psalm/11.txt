<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD'S throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.
