<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me: for there were many with me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.
