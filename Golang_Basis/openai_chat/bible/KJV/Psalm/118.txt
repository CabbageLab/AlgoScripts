<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: because his mercy endureth for ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy endureth for ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, and set me in a large place.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> They compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the LORD:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> This is the LORD'S doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
