<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Delight thyself also in the LORD; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright conversation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their strength in the time of trouble.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.
