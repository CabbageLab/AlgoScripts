<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my mother's belly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee to help me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> For the kingdom is the LORD'S: and he is the governor among the nations.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done this.
