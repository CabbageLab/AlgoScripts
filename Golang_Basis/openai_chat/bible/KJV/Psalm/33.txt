<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for the upright.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done in truth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver any by his great strength.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.
