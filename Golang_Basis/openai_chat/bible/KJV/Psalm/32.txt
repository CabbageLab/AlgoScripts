<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall compass him about.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.
