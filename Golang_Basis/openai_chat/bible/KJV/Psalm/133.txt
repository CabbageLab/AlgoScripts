<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.
