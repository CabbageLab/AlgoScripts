<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning they are like grass which groweth up.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale that is told.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.
