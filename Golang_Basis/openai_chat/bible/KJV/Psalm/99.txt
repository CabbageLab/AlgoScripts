<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between the cherubims; let the earth be moved.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all the people.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the LORD our God is holy.
