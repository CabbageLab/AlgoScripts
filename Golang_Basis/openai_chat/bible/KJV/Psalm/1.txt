<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.
