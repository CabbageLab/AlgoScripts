<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever.
