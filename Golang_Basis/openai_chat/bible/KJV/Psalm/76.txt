<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth.
