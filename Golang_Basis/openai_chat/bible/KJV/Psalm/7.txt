<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.
