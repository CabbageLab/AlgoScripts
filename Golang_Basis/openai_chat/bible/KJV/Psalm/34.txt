<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good thing.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.
