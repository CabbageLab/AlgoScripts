<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns for signs.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out of thy bosom.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually.
