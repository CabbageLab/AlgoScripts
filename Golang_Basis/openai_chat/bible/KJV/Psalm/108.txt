<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and answer me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.
