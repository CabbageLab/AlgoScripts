<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>41</bmstyle> Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>42</bmstyle> They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>43</bmstyle> How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>44</bmstyle> And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>45</bmstyle> He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>46</bmstyle> He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>47</bmstyle> He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>48</bmstyle> He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>49</bmstyle> He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>50</bmstyle> He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>51</bmstyle> And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>52</bmstyle> But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>53</bmstyle> And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>54</bmstyle> And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>55</bmstyle> He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>56</bmstyle> Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>57</bmstyle> But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>58</bmstyle> For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>59</bmstyle> When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>60</bmstyle> So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>61</bmstyle> And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>62</bmstyle> He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>63</bmstyle> The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>64</bmstyle> Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>65</bmstyle> Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>66</bmstyle> And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>67</bmstyle> Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>68</bmstyle> But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>69</bmstyle> And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>70</bmstyle> He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>71</bmstyle> From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>72</bmstyle> So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
