<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.
