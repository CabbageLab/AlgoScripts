<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> The mighty God, even the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge himself. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I am God, even thy God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings, to have been continually before me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy folds.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother's son.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.
