<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed which transgress without cause.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it is great.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> What man is he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and afflicted.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my distresses.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.
