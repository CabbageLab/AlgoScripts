<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and hear me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O God, which didst not go out with our armies?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.
