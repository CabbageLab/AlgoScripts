<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!
