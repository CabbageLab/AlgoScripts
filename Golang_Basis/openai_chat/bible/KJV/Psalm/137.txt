<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> How shall we sing the LORD'S song in a strange land?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.
