<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> It is a good thing to give thanks unto the LORD, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
