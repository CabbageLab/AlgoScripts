<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel say;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.
