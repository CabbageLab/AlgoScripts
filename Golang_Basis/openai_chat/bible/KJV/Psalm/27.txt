<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, LORD, will I seek.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will take me up.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.
