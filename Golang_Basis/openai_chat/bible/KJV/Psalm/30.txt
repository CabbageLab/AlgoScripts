<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.
