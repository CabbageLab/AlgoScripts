<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Put them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may know themselves to be but men. Selah.
