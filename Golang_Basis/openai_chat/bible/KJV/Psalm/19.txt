<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.
