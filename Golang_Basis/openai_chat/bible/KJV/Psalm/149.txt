<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Praise ye the LORD. Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise in the congregation of saints.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a twoedged sword in their hand;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the people;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints. Praise ye the LORD.
