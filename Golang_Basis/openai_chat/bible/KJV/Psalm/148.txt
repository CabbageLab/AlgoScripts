<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the LORD from the heavens: praise him in the heights.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above the heavens.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Let them praise the name of the LORD: for he commanded, and they were created.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a decree which shall not pass.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Praise the LORD from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Fire, and hail; snow, and vapour; stormy wind fulfilling his word:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye the LORD.
