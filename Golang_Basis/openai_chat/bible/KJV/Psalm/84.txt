<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.
