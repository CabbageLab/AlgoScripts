<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.
