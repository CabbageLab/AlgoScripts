<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they shall sing to thy name. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing toward the children of men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood on foot: there did we rejoice in him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is tried.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon our loins.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my soul.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.
