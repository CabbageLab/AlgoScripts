<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver him in time of trouble.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now that he lieth he shall rise up no more.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.
