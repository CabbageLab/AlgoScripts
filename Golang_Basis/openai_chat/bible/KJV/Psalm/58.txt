<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away: like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.
