<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the sea:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded with power:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, which is full of water: thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the springing thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop fatness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the little hills rejoice on every side.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.
