<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.
