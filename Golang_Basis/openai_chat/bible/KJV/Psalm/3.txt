<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> LORD, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they that rise up against me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy people. Selah.
