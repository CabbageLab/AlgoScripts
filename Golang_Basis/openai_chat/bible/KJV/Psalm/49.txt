<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Both low and high, rich and poor, together.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.
