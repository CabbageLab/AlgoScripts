<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord: my goodness extendeth not to thee;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.
