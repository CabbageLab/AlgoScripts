<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> LORD, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.
