<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Praise ye the LORD: for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> The LORD doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their names.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is infinite.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> The LORD lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to the ground.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth very swiftly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD.
