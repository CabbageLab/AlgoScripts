<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no soundness in my flesh.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.
