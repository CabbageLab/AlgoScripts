<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.
