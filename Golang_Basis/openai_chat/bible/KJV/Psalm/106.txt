<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth all his praise?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>41</bmstyle> And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>42</bmstyle> Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>43</bmstyle> Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>44</bmstyle> Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>45</bmstyle> And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>46</bmstyle> He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>47</bmstyle> Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>48</bmstyle> Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.
