<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for evermore.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the LORD'S name is to be praised.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the LORD.
