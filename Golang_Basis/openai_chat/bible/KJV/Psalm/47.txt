<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> For the LORD most high is terrible; he is a great King over all the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing praises.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> The princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth belong unto God: he is greatly exalted.
