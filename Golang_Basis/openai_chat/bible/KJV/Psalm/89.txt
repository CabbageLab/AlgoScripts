<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our king.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>41</bmstyle> All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>42</bmstyle> Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>43</bmstyle> Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>44</bmstyle> Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>45</bmstyle> The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>46</bmstyle> How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>47</bmstyle> Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>48</bmstyle> What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>49</bmstyle> Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarest unto David in thy truth?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>50</bmstyle> Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>51</bmstyle> Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>52</bmstyle> Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.
