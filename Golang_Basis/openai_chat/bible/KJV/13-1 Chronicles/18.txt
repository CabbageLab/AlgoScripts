<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them an hundred chariots.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Then David put garrisons in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, and brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.
