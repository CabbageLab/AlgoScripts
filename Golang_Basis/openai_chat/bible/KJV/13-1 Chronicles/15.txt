<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared for it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and thirty:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twelve.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And said unto them, Ye are the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto the place that I have prepared for it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> For because ye did it not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> And with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he instructed about the song, because he was skilful.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obededom with joy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also had upon him an ephod of linen.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart.
