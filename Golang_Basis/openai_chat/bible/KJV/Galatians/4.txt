<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not injured me at all.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.
