<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> I would they were even cut off which trouble you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.
