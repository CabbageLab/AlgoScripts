<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> For every man shall bear his own burden.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. [To the Galatians written from Rome.]
