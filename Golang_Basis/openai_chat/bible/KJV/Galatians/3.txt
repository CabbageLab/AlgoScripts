<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.
