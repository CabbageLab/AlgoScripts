<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> And they glorified God in me.
