<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle>
