<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> He appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD their God, and laid them by heaps.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD, and his people Israel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the LORD hath blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD; and they prepared them,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully: over which Cononiah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was the next.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the east, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of the LORD, and the most holy things.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And next him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their set office, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as to the small:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Beside their genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even unto every one that entereth into the house of the LORD, his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their courses;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges by their courses;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> And to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Also of the sons of Aaron the priests, which were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every several city, the men that were expressed by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the Levites.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought that which was good and right and truth before the LORD his God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.
