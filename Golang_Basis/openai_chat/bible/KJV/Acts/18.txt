<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> And he drave them from the judgment seat.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.
