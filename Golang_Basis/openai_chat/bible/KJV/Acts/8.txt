<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And there was great joy in that city.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.
