<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all men glorified God for that which was done.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> And laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> Having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet.
