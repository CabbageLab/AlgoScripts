<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order unto them, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.
