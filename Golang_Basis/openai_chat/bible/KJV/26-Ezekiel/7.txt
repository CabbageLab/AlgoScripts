<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Now is the end come upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble is near, and not the sounding again of the mountains.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense thee for all thine abominations.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations that are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am the LORD that smiteth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs: neither shall there be wailing for them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, which shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die with the sword; and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels: because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things therein: therefore have I set it far from them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret place: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.
