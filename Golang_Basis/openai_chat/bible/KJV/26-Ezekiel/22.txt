<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh idols against herself to defile herself.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen, and a mocking to all countries.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Those that be near, and those that be far from thee, shall mock thee, which art infamous and much vexed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their power to shed blood.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit lewdness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> In thee have they discovered their fathers' nakedness: in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour's wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father's daughter.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord GOD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I the LORD have spoken it, and will do it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are even the dross of silver.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it; so will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave you there, and melt you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the LORD have poured out my fury upon you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Son of man, say unto her, Thou art the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> And her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter, seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord GOD, when the LORD hath not spoken.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD.
