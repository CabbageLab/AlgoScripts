<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion: whoso provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> It is an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be meddling.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> The just man walketh in his integrity: his children are blessed after him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike abomination to the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Take his garment that is surety for a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Say not thou, I will recompense evil; but wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Divers weights are an abomination unto the LORD; and a false balance is not good.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Man's goings are of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and after vows to make enquiry.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> The glory of young men is their strength: and the beauty of old men is the gray head.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so do stripes the inward parts of the belly.
