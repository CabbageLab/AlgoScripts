<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD: but he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride: but the lips of the wise shall preserve them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Where no oxen are, the crib is clean: but much increase is by the strength of the ox.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will utter lies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not: but knowledge is easy unto him that understandeth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way: but the folly of fools is deceit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous there is favour.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth is heaviness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and a good man shall be satisfied from himself.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh well to his going.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool rageth, and is confident.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked devices is hated.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich hath many friends.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath mercy on the poor, happy is he.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> The crown of the wise is their riches: but the foolishness of fools is folly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> A true witness delivereth souls: but a deceitful witness speaketh lies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> In the fear of the LORD is strong confidence: and his children shall have a place of refuge.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> In the multitude of people is the king's honour: but in the want of people is the destruction of the prince.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness of the bones.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous hath hope in his death.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: but that which is in the midst of fools is made known.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> The king's favour is toward a wise servant: but his wrath is against him that causeth shame.
