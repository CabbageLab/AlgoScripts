<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> A poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all things.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good things in possession.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Happy is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler over the poor people.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor: but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> A man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> To have respect of persons is not good: for for a piece of bread that man will transgress.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression; the same is the companion of a destroyer.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase.
