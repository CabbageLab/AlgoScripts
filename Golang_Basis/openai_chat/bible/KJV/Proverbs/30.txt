<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is enough:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it cannot bear:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in going:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there is no rising up.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.
