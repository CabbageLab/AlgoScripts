<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.
