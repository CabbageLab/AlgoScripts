<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the LORD pondereth the hearts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> An high look, and a proud heart, and the plowing of the wicked, is sin.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but of every one that is hasty only to want.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> The way of man is froward and strange: but as for the pure, his work is right.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked: but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> It is joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry woman.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Proud and haughty scorner is his name, who dealeth in proud wrath.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and spareth not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination: how much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> A wicked man hardeneth his face: but as for the upright, he directeth his way.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> The horse is prepared against the day of battle: but safety is of the LORD.
