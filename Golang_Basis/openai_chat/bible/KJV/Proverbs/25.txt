<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not a secret to another:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their own glory is not glory.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls.
