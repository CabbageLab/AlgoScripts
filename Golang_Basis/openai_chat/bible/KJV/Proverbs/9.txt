<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth nothing.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> To call passengers who go right on their ways:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths of hell.
