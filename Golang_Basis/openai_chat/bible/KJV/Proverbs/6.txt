<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.
