<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices with strife.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD trieth the hearts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Children's children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> An evil man seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both are abomination to the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh surety in the presence of his friend.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for equity.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.
