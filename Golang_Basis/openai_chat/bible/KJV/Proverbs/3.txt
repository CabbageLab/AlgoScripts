<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.
