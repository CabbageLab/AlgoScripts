<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what is before thee:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful meat.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart is not with thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sweet words.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> For their redeemer is mighty; he shall plead their cause with thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Let not thine heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of the LORD all the day long.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be cut off.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> For a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow pit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> She also lieth in wait as for a prey, and increaseth the transgressors among men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not sick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.
