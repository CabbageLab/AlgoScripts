<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters, and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his soul.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a castle.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.
