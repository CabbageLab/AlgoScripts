<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing froward or perverse in them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my ways.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.
