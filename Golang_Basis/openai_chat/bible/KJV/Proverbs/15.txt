<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> The eyes of the LORD are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> A fool despiseth his father's instruction: but he that regardeth reproof is prudent.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> In the house of the righteous is much treasure: but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the foolish doeth not so.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright is his delight.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD: but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way: and he that hateth reproof shall die.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Hell and destruction are before the LORD: how much more then the hearts of the children of men?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him: neither will he go unto the wise.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge: but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> All the days of the afflicted are evil: but he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Better is little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure and trouble therewith.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> The way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns: but the way of the righteous is made plain.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth his mother.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom: but a man of understanding walketh uprightly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the multitude of counsellors they are established.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word spoken in due season, how good is it!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> The way of life is above to the wise, that he may depart from hell beneath.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> The LORD will destroy the house of the proud: but he will establish the border of the widow.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the LORD: but the words of the pure are pleasant words.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that hateth gifts shall live.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> The LORD is far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of the righteous.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: and a good report maketh the bones fat.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom; and before honour is humility.
