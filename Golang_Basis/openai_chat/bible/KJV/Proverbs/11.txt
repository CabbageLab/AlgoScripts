<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> A false balance is abomination to the LORD: but a just weight is his delight.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> When pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly is wisdom.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivereth from death.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish: and the hope of unjust men perisheth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> An hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but through knowledge shall the just be delivered.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and when the wicked perish, there is shouting.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man of understanding holdeth his peace.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellors there is safety.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it: and he that hateth suretiship is sure.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong men retain riches.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> As righteousness tendeth to life: so he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> They that are of a froward heart are abomination to the LORD: but such as are upright in their way are his delight.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman which is without discretion.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> The desire of the righteous is only good: but the expectation of the wicked is wrath.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> He that trusteth in his riches shall fall: but the righteous shall flourish as a branch.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is wise.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much more the wicked and the sinner.
