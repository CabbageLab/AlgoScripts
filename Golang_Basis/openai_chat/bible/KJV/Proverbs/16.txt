<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, is from the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the LORD weigheth the spirits.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> A just weight and balance are the LORD'S: all the weights of the bag are his work.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne is established by righteousness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> In the light of the king's countenance is life; and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy is he.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools is folly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips there is as a burning fire.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.
