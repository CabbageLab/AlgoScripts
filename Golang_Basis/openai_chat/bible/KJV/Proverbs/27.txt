<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath is heavier than them both.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Open rebuke is better than secret love.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that wandereth from his place.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity: for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the simple pass on, and are punished.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, which bewrayeth itself.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is a man to his praise.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> For riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to every generation?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of the field.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> And thou shalt have goats' milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and for the maintenance for thy maidens.
