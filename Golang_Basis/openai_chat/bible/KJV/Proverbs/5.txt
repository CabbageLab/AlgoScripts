<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
