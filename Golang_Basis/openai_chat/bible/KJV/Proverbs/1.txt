<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.
