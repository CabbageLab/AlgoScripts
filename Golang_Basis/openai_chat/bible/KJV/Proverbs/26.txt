<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly for a fool.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool's back.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, and drinketh damage.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the mouth of fools.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth honour to a fool.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the mouth of fools.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> The great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his folly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope of a fool than of him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon his bed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> As a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a contentious man to kindle strife.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with silver dross.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be shewed before the whole congregation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin.
