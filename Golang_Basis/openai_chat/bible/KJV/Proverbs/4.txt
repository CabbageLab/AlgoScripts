<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.
