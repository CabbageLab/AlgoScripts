<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth reproof is brutish.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> A good man obtaineth favour of the LORD: but a man of wicked devices will he condemn.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of the righteous shall not be moved.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband: but she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> The thoughts of the righteous are right: but the counsels of the wicked are deceit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood: but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> The wicked are overthrown, and are not: but the house of the righteous shall stand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> He that is despised, and hath a servant, is better than he that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he that followeth vain persons is void of understanding.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> The wicked desireth the net of evil men: but the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips: but the just shall come out of trouble.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth: and the recompence of a man's hands shall be rendered unto him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> A fool's wrath is presently known: but a prudent man covereth shame.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> He that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness: but a false witness deceit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the tongue of the wise is health.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue is but for a moment.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the counsellors of peace is joy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall be filled with mischief.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Lying lips are abomination to the LORD: but they that deal truly are his delight.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful shall be under tribute.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word maketh it glad.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour: but the way of the wicked seduceth them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting: but the substance of a diligent man is precious.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> In the way of righteousness is life; and in the pathway thereof there is no death.
