<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall not escape.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall perish.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his glory to pass over a transgression.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour is as dew upon the grass.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife is from the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but he that despiseth his ways shall die.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver him, yet thou must do it again.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> The desire of a man is his kindness: and a poor man is better than a liar.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.
