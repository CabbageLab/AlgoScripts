<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.
