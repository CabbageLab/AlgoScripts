<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And in that day shall ye say, Praise the LORD, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Sing unto the LORD; for he hath done excellent things: this is known in all the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.
