<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the womb, which will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the water courses.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> One shall say, I am the LORD'S; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the LORD, and surname himself by the name of Israel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the things that are coming, and shall come, let them shew unto them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that time, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses. Is there a God beside me? yea, there is no God; I know not any.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed: and the workmen, they are of men: let them all be gathered together, let them stand up; yet they shall fear, and they shall be ashamed together.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the strength of his arms: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth: he drinketh no water, and is faint.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> The carpenter stretcheth out his rule; he marketh it out with a line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the house.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the oak, which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest: he planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof, and warm himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread; yea, he maketh a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he warmeth himself, and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven image: he falleth down unto it, and worshippeth it, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> They have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot understand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> And none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh, and eaten it: and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> He feedeth on ashes: a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou art my servant: I have formed thee; thou art my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done it: shout, ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Thus saith the LORD, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, I am the LORD that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and I will raise up the decayed places thereof:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> That saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> That saith of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.
