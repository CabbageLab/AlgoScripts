<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come forth to make war with thee. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Telassar?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Incline thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD, and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent to reproach the living God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations, and their countries,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD, even thou only.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> This is the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the height of his border, and the forest of his Carmel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> Hast thou not heard long ago, how I have done it; and of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heaps.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded: they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.
