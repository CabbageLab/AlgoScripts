<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Shake thyself from the dust; arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and ye shall be redeemed without money.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down aforetime into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them to howl, saith the LORD; and my name continually every day is blasphemed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore they shall know in that day that I am he that doth speak: behold, it is I.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the LORD shall bring again Zion.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem: for the LORD hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean thing; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the LORD will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your rereward.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> As many were astonished at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider.
