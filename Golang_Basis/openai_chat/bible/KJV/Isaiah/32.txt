<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl said to be bountiful.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> For the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error against the LORD, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> The instruments also of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the needy speaketh right.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things shall he stand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye careless daughters; give ear unto my speech.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women: for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless ones: strip you, and make you bare, and gird sackcloth upon your loins.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> They shall lament for the teats, for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the city shall be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness remain in the fruitful field.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> When it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the city shall be low in a low place.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth thither the feet of the ox and the ass.
