<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth, their idols were upon the beasts, and upon the cattle: your carriages were heavy loaden; they are a burden to the weary beast.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, which are borne by me from the belly, which are carried from the womb:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> To whom will ye liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be like?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> They lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, and hire a goldsmith; and he maketh it a god: they fall down, yea, they worship.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him in his place, and he standeth; from his place shall he not remove: yea, one shall cry unto him, yet can he not answer, nor save him out of his trouble.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Remember this, and shew yourselves men: bring it again to mind, O ye transgressors.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executeth my counsel from a far country: yea, I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that are far from righteousness:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry: and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.
