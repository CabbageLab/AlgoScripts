<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> I the LORD have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> I am the LORD: that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Let them give glory unto the LORD, and declare his praise in the islands.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and refrained myself: now will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye are our gods.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I sent? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the LORD'S servant?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears, but he heareth not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honourable.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Who among you will give ear to this? who will hearken and hear for the time to come?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the LORD, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.
