<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger, even them that rejoice in my highness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the LORD of hosts mustereth the host of the battle.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, even the LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Howl ye; for the day of the LORD is at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart shall melt:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as flames.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man taketh up: they shall every man turn to his own people, and flee every one into his own land.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard silver; and as for gold, they shall not delight in it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not spare children.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces: and her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.
