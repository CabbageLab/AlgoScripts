<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> For the Egyptians buried all their firstborn, which the LORD had smitten among them: upon their gods also the LORD executed judgments.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> And they removed from Haradah, and pitched in Makheloth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> And they removed from Makheloth, and encamped at Tahath.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> And they departed from Tahath, and pitched at Tarah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> And they removed from Tarah, and pitched in Mithcah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> And they removed from Kadesh, and pitched in mount Hor, in the edge of the land of Edom.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of the LORD, and died there, in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the first day of the fifth month.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> And Aaron was an hundred and twenty and three years old when he died in mount Hor.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> And king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>49</bmstyle> And they pitched by Jordan, from Bethjesimoth even unto Abelshittim in the plains of Moab.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>50</bmstyle> And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>51</bmstyle> Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>52</bmstyle> Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high places:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>53</bmstyle> And ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein: for I have given you the land to possess it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>54</bmstyle> And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance: every man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>55</bmstyle> But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>56</bmstyle> Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do unto you, as I thought to do unto them.
