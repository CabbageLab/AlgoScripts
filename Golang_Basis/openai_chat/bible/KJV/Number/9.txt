<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> And those men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
