<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all the instruments thereof, both the altar and all the vessels thereof, and had anointed them, and sanctified them;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> That the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, who were the princes of the tribes, and were over them that were numbered, offered:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> And they brought their offering before the LORD, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for two of the princes, and for each one an ox: and they brought them before the tabernacle.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Take it of them, that they may be to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to every man according to his service.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the Levites.
