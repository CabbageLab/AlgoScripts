<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> These also are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that the LORD spake with Moses in mount Sinai.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And these are the names of the sons of Aaron; Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests which were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest's office.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD, when they offered strange fire before the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children: and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest's office in the sight of Aaron their father.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister unto him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation, to do the service of the tabernacle.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons: they are wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall wait on their priest's office: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the firstborn that openeth the matrix among the children of Israel: therefore the Levites shall be mine;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Because all the firstborn are mine; for on the day that I smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast: mine shall they be: I am the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers, by their families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> And Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD, as he was commanded.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And these were the sons of Levi by their names; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families; Libni, and Shimei.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> And the sons of Kohath by their families; Amram, and Izehar, Hebron, and Uzziel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> And the sons of Merari by their families; Mahli, and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to the house of their fathers.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Of Gershon was the family of the Libnites, and the family of the Shimites: these are the families of the Gershonites.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, even those that were numbered of them were seven thousand and five hundred.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> The families of the Gershonites shall pitch behind the tabernacle westward.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> And the chief of the house of the father of the Gershonites shall be Eliasaph the son of Lael.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation shall be the tabernacle, and the tent, the covering thereof, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> And the hangings of the court, and the curtain for the door of the court, which is by the tabernacle, and by the altar round about, and the cords of it for all the service thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> And of Kohath was the family of the Amramites, and the family of the Izeharites, and the family of the Hebronites, and the family of the Uzzielites: these are the families of the Kohathites.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> In the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, were eight thousand and six hundred, keeping the charge of the sanctuary.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> The families of the sons of Kohath shall pitch on the side of the tabernacle southward.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> And the chief of the house of the father of the families of the Kohathites shall be Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> And their charge shall be the ark, and the table, and the candlestick, and the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary wherewith they minister, and the hanging, and all the service thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be chief over the chief of the Levites, and have the oversight of them that keep the charge of the sanctuary.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> Of Merari was the family of the Mahlites, and the family of the Mushites: these are the families of Merari.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> And those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, were six thousand and two hundred.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> And the chief of the house of the father of the families of Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail: these shall pitch on the side of the tabernacle northward.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> And under the custody and charge of the sons of Merari shall be the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof, and all the vessels thereof, and all that serveth thereto,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> But those that encamp before the tabernacle toward the east, even before the tabernacle of the congregation eastward, shall be Moses, and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge of the sanctuary for the charge of the children of Israel; and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> All that were numbered of the Levites, which Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of the LORD, throughout their families, all the males from a month old and upward, were twenty and two thousand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> And the LORD said unto Moses, Number all the firstborn of the males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>41</bmstyle> And thou shalt take the Levites for me (I am the LORD) instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel; and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the children of Israel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>42</bmstyle> And Moses numbered, as the LORD commanded him, all the firstborn among the children of Israel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>43</bmstyle> And all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a month old and upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>44</bmstyle> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>45</bmstyle> Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall be mine: I am the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>46</bmstyle> And for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred and threescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of Israel, which are more than the Levites;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>47</bmstyle> Thou shalt even take five shekels apiece by the poll, after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take them: (the shekel is twenty gerahs:)

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>48</bmstyle> And thou shalt give the money, wherewith the odd number of them is to be redeemed, unto Aaron and to his sons.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>49</bmstyle> And Moses took the redemption money of them that were over and above them that were redeemed by the Levites:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>50</bmstyle> Of the firstborn of the children of Israel took he the money; a thousand three hundred and threescore and five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>51</bmstyle> And Moses gave the money of them that were redeemed unto Aaron and to his sons, according to the word of the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses.
