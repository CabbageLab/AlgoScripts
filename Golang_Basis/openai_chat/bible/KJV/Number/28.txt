<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My offering, and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, for a sweet savour unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto the LORD; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day, for a continual burnt offering.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a meat offering, mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> And the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an hin for the one lamb: in the holy place shalt thou cause the strong wine to be poured unto the LORD for a drink offering.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meat offering of the morning, and as the drink offering thereof, thou shalt offer it, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot, and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> This is the burnt offering of every sabbath, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs of the first year without spot;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And three tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one bullock; and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one ram;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> And a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil for a meat offering unto one lamb; for a burnt offering of a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine unto a bullock, and the third part of an hin unto a ram, and a fourth part of an hin unto a lamb: this is the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the LORD shall be offered, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> And in the fourteenth day of the first month is the passover of the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And in the fifteenth day of this month is the feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> In the first day shall be an holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work therein:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> But ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven lambs of the first year: they shall be unto you without blemish:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil: three tenth deals shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth deals for a ram;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> A several tenth deal shalt thou offer for every lamb, throughout the seven lambs:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> And one goat for a sin offering, to make an atonement for you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Ye shall offer these beside the burnt offering in the morning, which is for a continual burnt offering.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> After this manner ye shall offer daily, throughout the seven days, the meat of the sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD: it shall be offered beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> And on the seventh day ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> Also in the day of the firstfruits, when ye bring a new meat offering unto the LORD, after your weeks be out, ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> But ye shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD; two young bullocks, one ram, seven lambs of the first year;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> And their meat offering of flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals unto one bullock, two tenth deals unto one ram,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> A several tenth deal unto one lamb, throughout the seven lambs;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> And one kid of the goats, to make an atonement for you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> Ye shall offer them beside the continual burnt offering, and his meat offering, (they shall be unto you without blemish) and their drink offerings.
