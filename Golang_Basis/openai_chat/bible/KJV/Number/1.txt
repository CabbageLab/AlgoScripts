<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>49</bmstyle> Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum of them among the children of Israel:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>50</bmstyle> But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all things that belong to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>51</bmstyle> And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>52</bmstyle> And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>53</bmstyle> But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>54</bmstyle> And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.
