<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:)

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord GOD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.
