<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I am the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the families of Levi according to their generations.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these are the families of the Korhites.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> And Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> And it came to pass on the day when the LORD spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> That the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I am the LORD: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?
