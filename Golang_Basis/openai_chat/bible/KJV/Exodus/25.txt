<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering: of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold, and silver, and brass,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for sweet incense,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the breastplate.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four corners thereof; and two rings shall be in the one side of it, and two rings in the other side of it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> And thou shalt make staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, that the ark may be borne with them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be taken from it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> And thou shalt make two cherubims of gold, of beaten work shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the other end: even of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the two ends thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> And the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Thou shalt also make a table of shittim wood: two cubits shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold round about.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> And thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand breadth round about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Over against the border shall the rings be for places of the staves to bear the table.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be borne with them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and spoons thereof, and covers thereof, and bowls thereof, to cover withal: of pure gold shalt thou make them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> And thou shalt set upon the table shewbread before me alway.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> And six branches shall come out of the sides of it; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> Three bowls made like unto almonds, with a knop and a flower in one branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch, with a knop and a flower: so in the six branches that come out of the candlestick.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> And in the candlestick shall be four bowls made like unto almonds, with their knops and their flowers.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> And there shall be a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches that proceed out of the candlestick.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> Their knops and their branches shall be of the same: all it shall be one beaten work of pure gold.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall light the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be of pure gold.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these vessels.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was shewed thee in the mount.
