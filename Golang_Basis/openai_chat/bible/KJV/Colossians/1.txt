<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.
