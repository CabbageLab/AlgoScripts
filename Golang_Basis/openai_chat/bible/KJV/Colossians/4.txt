<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They shall make known unto you all things which are done here.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;)

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen. [Written from Rome to Colossians by Tychicus and Onesimus.]
