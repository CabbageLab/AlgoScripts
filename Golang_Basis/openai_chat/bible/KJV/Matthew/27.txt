<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> And sitting down they watched him there;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>41</bmstyle> Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>42</bmstyle> He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>43</bmstyle> He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>44</bmstyle> The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>45</bmstyle> Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>46</bmstyle> And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>47</bmstyle> Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>48</bmstyle> And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>49</bmstyle> The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>50</bmstyle> Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>51</bmstyle> And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>52</bmstyle> And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>53</bmstyle> And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>54</bmstyle> Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>55</bmstyle> And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>56</bmstyle> Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>57</bmstyle> When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>58</bmstyle> He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>59</bmstyle> And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>60</bmstyle> And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>61</bmstyle> And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>62</bmstyle> Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>63</bmstyle> Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>64</bmstyle> Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>65</bmstyle> Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>66</bmstyle> So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.
