<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Give us this day our daily bread.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.
