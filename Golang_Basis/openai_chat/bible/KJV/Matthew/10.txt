<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And when ye come into an house, salute it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>41</bmstyle> He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>42</bmstyle> And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.
