<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> For many are called, but few are chosen.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> And last of all the woman died also.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> Master, which is the great commandment in the law?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> This is the first and great commandment.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>41</bmstyle> While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>42</bmstyle> Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, The Son of David.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>43</bmstyle> He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>44</bmstyle> The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>45</bmstyle> If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>46</bmstyle> And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.
