<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.
