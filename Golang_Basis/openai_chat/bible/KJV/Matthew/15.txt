<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.
