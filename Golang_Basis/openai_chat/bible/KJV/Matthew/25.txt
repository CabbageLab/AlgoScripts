<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>41</bmstyle> Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>42</bmstyle> For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>43</bmstyle> I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>44</bmstyle> Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>45</bmstyle> Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>46</bmstyle> And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.
