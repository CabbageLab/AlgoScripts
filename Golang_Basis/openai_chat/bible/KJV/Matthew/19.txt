<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.
