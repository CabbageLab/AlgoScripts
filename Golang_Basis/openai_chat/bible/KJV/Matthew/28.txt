<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.
