<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>41</bmstyle> Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>42</bmstyle> He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>43</bmstyle> And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>44</bmstyle> And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>45</bmstyle> Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>46</bmstyle> Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>47</bmstyle> And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>48</bmstyle> Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>49</bmstyle> And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>50</bmstyle> And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>51</bmstyle> And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>52</bmstyle> Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>53</bmstyle> Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>54</bmstyle> But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>55</bmstyle> In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>56</bmstyle> But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>57</bmstyle> And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>58</bmstyle> But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>59</bmstyle> Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>60</bmstyle> But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>61</bmstyle> And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>62</bmstyle> And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>63</bmstyle> But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>64</bmstyle> Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>65</bmstyle> Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>66</bmstyle> What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>67</bmstyle> Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>68</bmstyle> Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>69</bmstyle> Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>70</bmstyle> But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>71</bmstyle> And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>72</bmstyle> And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>73</bmstyle> And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>74</bmstyle> Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>75</bmstyle> And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.
