<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word which he commanded to a thousand generations;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Even of the covenant which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day his salvation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among all nations.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also is to be feared above all gods.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> For all the gods of the people are idols: but the LORD made the heavens.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Glory and honour are in his presence; strength and gladness are in his place.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let men say among the nations, The LORD reigneth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that is therein.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, and glory in thy praise.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> Blessed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> And Obededom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be porters:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and to do according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>41</bmstyle> And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>42</bmstyle> And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were porters.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>43</bmstyle> And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.
