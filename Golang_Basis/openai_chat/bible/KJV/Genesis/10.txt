<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
