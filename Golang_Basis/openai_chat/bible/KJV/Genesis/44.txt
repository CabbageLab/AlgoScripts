<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.
