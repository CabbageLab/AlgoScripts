<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons of Adah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their dukes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's sister was Timna.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are the dukes that came of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his city was Dinhabah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>41</bmstyle> Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,
