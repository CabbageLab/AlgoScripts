<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.
