<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen. [The second epistle unto Timotheus, ordained the first bishop of the church of the Ephesians, was written from Rome, when Paul was brought before Nero the second time.]
