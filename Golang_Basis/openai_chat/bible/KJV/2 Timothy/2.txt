<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.
