<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.
