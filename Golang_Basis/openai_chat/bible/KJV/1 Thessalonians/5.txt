<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Rejoice evermore.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Pray without ceasing.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Quench not the Spirit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Despise not prophesyings.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Abstain from all appearance of evil.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Brethren, pray for us.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen. [The first epistle to the Thessalonians was written from Athens.]
