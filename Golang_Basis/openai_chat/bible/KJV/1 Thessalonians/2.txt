<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God is witness:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> For ye are our glory and joy.
