<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Wherefore comfort one another with these words.
