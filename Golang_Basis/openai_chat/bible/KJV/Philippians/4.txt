<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellowlabourers, whose names are in the book of life.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. [To the Philippians written from Rome, by Epaphroditus.]
