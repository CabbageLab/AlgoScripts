<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Do all things without murmurings and disputings:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.
