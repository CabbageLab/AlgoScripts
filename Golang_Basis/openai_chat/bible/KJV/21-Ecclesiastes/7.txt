<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the sun.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and madness:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one by one, to find out the account:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.
