<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which proceedeth from the ruler:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all things.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.
