<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.
