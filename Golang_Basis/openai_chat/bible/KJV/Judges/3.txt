<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.
