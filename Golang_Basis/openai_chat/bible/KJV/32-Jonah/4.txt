<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?
