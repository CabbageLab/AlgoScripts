<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> And they cried out again, Crucify him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> Save thyself, and come down from the cross.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>41</bmstyle> (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>42</bmstyle> And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>43</bmstyle> Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>44</bmstyle> And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>45</bmstyle> And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>46</bmstyle> And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>47</bmstyle> And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.
