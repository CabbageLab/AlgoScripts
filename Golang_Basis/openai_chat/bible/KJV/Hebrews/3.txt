<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
