<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> And having an high priest over the house of God;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.
