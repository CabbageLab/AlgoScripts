<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel; Is it not for you to know judgment?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the LORD, and say, Is not the LORD among us? none evil can come upon us.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.
