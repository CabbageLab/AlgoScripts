<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time is evil.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> In that day shall one take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed it from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, that they shall not take shame.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> O thou that art named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened? are these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them.
