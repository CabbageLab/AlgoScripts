<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of her friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for another man: so will I also be for thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days.
