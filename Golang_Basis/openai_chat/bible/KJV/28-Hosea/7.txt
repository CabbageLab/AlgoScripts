<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers spoileth without.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, and they rebel against me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> They return, but not to the most High: they are like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.
