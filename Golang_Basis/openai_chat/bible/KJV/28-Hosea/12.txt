<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he had power with God:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him in Bethel, and there he spake with us;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Even the LORD God of hosts; the LORD is his memorial.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Is there iniquity in Gilead? surely they are vanity: they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the fields.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved.
