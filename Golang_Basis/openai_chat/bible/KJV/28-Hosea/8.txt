<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Set the trumpet to thy mouth. He shall come as an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Israel hath cast off the thing that is good: the enemy shall pursue him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> For from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore it is not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein is no pleasure.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> I have written to him the great things of my law, but they were counted as a strange thing.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat it; but the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.
