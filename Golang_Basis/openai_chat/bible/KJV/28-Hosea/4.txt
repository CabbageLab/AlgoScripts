<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people are as they that strive with the priest.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore will I change their glory into shame.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD liveth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers with shame do love, Give ye.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.
