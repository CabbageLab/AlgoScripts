<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with blood.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned the captivity of my people.
