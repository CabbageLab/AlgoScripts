<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they be the children of whoredoms.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God.
