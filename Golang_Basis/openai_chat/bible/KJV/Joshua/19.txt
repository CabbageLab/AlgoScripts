<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> And the second lot came forth to Simeon, even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families: and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And they had in their inheritance Beersheba, or Sheba, and Moladah,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> And Hazarshual, and Balah, and Azem,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And Ziklag, and Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusah,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And Bethlebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities and their villages:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Ain, Remmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities and their villages:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And all the villages that were round about these cities to Baalathbeer, Ramath of the south. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Out of the portion of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon: for the part of the children of Judah was too much for them: therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance within the inheritance of them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their families: and the border of their inheritance was unto Sarid:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And their border went up toward the sea, and Maralah, and reached to Dabbasheth, and reached to the river that is before Jokneam;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the border of Chislothtabor, and then goeth out to Daberath, and goeth up to Japhia,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to their families, these cities with their villages.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And the fourth lot came out to Issachar, for the children of Issachar according to their families.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> And Rabbith, and Kishion, and Abez,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> And Remeth, and Engannim, and Enhaddah, and Bethpazzez;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> And the coast reacheth to Tabor, and Shahazimah, and Bethshemesh; and the outgoings of their border were at Jordan: sixteen cities with their villages.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar according to their families, the cities and their villages.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> And their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> And Alammelech, and Amad, and Misheal; and reacheth to Carmel westward, and to Shihorlibnath;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> And turneth toward the sunrising to Bethdagon, and reacheth to Zebulun, and to the valley of Jiphthahel toward the north side of Bethemek, and Neiel, and goeth out to Cabul on the left hand,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> And Hebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even unto great Zidon;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> And then the coast turneth to Ramah, and to the strong city Tyre; and the coast turneth to Hosah; and the outgoings thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty and two cities with their villages.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> The sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali, even for the children of Naphtali according to their families.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> And their coast was from Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim, and Adami, Nekeb, and Jabneel, unto Lakum; and the outgoings thereof were at Jordan:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> And then the coast turneth westward to Aznothtabor, and goeth out from thence to Hukkok, and reacheth to Zebulun on the south side, and reacheth to Asher on the west side, and to Judah upon Jordan toward the sunrising.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> And the fenced cities are Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> And Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> And Kedesh, and Edrei, and Enhazor,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> And Iron, and Migdalel, Horem, and Bethanath, and Bethshemesh; nineteen cities with their villages.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families, the cities and their villages.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> And the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>41</bmstyle> And the coast of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and Irshemesh,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>42</bmstyle> And Shaalabbin, and Ajalon, and Jethlah,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>47</bmstyle> And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>48</bmstyle> This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>49</bmstyle> When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance by their coasts, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>50</bmstyle> According to the word of the LORD they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnathserah in mount Ephraim: and he built the city, and dwelt therein.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>51</bmstyle> These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. So they made an end of dividing the country.
