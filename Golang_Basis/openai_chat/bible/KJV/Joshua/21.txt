<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>42</bmstyle> These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them: thus were all these cities.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>43</bmstyle> And the LORD gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to give unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>44</bmstyle> And the LORD gave them rest round about, according to all that he sware unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them; the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>45</bmstyle> There failed not ought of any good thing which the LORD had spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass.
