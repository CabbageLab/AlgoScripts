<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Now these are the priests and the Levites that went up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Shechaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Iddo, Ginnetho, Abijah,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Miamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Shemaiah, and Joiarib, Jedaiah,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah. These were the chief of the priests and of their brethren in the days of Jeshua.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Moreover the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, which was over the thanksgiving, he and his brethren.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their brethren, were over against them in the watches.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And Jeshua begat Joiakim, Joiakim also begat Eliashib, and Eliashib begat Joiada,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And Joiada begat Jonathan, and Jonathan begat Jaddua.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And in the days of Joiakim were priests, the chief of the fathers: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Of Melicu, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> And of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethaneel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> The Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua, were recorded chief of the fathers: also the priests, to the reign of Darius the Persian.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> The sons of Levi, the chief of the fathers, were written in the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> And the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise and to give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, ward over against ward.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were porters keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest, the scribe.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain country round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of Netophathi;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Also from the house of Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages round about Jerusalem.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks, whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> And certain of the priests' sons with trumpets; namely, Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe before them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> And the other company of them that gave thanks went over against them, and I after them, and the half of the people upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still in the prison gate.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>41</bmstyle> And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>42</bmstyle> And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>43</bmstyle> Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>44</bmstyle> And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>45</bmstyle> And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>46</bmstyle> For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>47</bmstyle> And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day his portion: and they sanctified holy things unto the Levites; and the Levites sanctified them unto the children of Aaron.
