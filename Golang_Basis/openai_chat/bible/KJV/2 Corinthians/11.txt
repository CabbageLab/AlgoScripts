<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.
