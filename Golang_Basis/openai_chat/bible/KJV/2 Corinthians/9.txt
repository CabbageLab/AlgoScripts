<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> (As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.
