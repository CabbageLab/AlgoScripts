<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.
