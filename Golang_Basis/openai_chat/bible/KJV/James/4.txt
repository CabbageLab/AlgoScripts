<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.
