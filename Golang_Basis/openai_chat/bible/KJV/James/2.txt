<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.
