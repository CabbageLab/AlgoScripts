<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Do not err, my beloved brethren.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.
