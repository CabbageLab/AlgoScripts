<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> But godliness with contentment is great gain.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen. [The first to Timothy was written from Laodicea, which is the chiefest city of Phrygia Pacatiana.]
