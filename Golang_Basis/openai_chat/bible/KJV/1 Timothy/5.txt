<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Honour widows that are widows indeed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> For some are already turned aside after Satan.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his reward.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep thyself pure.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.
