<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> These things command and teach.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.
