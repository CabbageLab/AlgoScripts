<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> For Adam was first formed, then Eve.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.
