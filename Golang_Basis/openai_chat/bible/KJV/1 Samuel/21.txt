<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of bread in mine hand, or what there is present.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore then have ye brought him to me?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?
