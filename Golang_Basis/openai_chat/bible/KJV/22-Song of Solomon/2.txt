<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.
