<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among the lilies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one barren among them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to see whether the vine flourished, and the pomegranates budded.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies.
