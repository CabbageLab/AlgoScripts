<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said, Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> It was but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.
