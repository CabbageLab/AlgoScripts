<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> The song of songs, which is Solomon's.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, thy neck with chains of gold.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> A bundle of myrrh is my wellbeloved unto me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed is green.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir.
