<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children which have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD hath destroyed them unto this day;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into this place;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go to possess it;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> And that ye may prolong your days in the land, which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land that floweth with milk and honey.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> But the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And then the LORD'S wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day.
