<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against his house.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Now the city was large and great: but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first, and found written therein,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> These are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city;
