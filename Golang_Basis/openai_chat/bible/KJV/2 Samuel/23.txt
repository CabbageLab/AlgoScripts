<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and slew them, and had the name among three.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the first three.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three. And David set him over his guard.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
