<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And he said, The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his ears.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under his feet.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes, I did not depart from them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our God?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> He maketh my feet like hinds' feet: and setteth me upon my high places.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>41</bmstyle> Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>42</bmstyle> They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>43</bmstyle> Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>44</bmstyle> Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>45</bmstyle> Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>46</bmstyle> Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>47</bmstyle> The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>48</bmstyle> It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>49</bmstyle> And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>50</bmstyle> Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>51</bmstyle> He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.
