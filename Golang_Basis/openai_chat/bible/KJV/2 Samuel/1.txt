<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD'S anointed?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD'S anointed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!
