<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.
