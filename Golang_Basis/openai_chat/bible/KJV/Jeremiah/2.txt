<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Israel was holiness unto the LORD, and the firstfruits of his increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon them, saith the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Hear ye the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Thus saith the LORD, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Neither said they, Where is the LORD that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made mine heritage an abomination.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the LORD, and with your children's children will I plead.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Is Israel a servant? is he a homeborn slave? why is he spoiled?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> The young lions roared upon him, and yelled, and they made his land waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of thy head.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, when he led thee by the way?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> For of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bands; and thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest, playing the harlot.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord GOD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: thou art a swift dromedary traversing her ways;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> A wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: but thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Saying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not their face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed against me, saith the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> O generation, see ye the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness? wherefore say my people, We are lords; we will come no more unto thee?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me. Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine head: for the LORD hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not prosper in them.
