<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the LORD, return unto me: and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight, then shalt thou not remove.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And thou shalt swear, The LORD liveth, in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For thus saith the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye the trumpet in the land: cry, gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the defenced cities.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Set up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate; and thy cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the fierce anger of the LORD is not turned back from us.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the LORD, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Even a full wind from those places shall come unto me: now also will I give sentence against them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be as a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are spoiled.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from mount Ephraim.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, that watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> As keepers of a field, are they against her round about; because she hath been rebellious against me, saith the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee; this is thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it reacheth unto thine heart.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is spoiled: suddenly are my tents spoiled, and my curtains in a moment.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> For my people is foolish, they have not known me; they are sottish children, and they have none understanding: they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce anger.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black: because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not repent, neither will I turn back from it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city shall be forsaken, and not a man dwell therein.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; thy lovers will despise thee, they will seek thy life.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, that bewaileth herself, that spreadeth her hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers.
