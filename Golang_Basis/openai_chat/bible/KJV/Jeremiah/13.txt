<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Thus saith the LORD unto me, Go and get thee a linen girdle, and put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> So I got a girdle according to the word of the LORD, and put it on my loins.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Take the girdle that thou hast got, which is upon thy loins, and arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And it came to pass after many days, that the LORD said unto me, Arise, go to Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded thee to hide there.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Then I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it: and, behold, the girdle was marred, it was profitable for nothing.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Thus saith the LORD, After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in the imagination of their heart, and walk after other gods, to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is good for nothing.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith the LORD; that they might be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word; Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and they shall say unto thee, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David's throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith the LORD: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for the LORD hath spoken.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Give glory to the LORD your God, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because the LORD'S flock is carried away captive.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Say unto the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down: for your principalities shall come down, even the crown of your glory.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open them: Judah shall be carried away captive all of it, it shall be wholly carried away captive.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee? for thou hast taught them to be captains, and as chief over thee: shall not sorrows take thee, as a woman in travail?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> And if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore come these things upon me? For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered, and thy heels made bare.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> This is thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith the LORD; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> Therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy shame may appear.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy whoredom, and thine abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! wilt thou not be made clean? when shall it once be?
