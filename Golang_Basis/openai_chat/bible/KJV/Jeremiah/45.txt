<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto thee, O Baruch;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the LORD hath added grief to my sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Thus shalt thou say unto him, The LORD saith thus; Behold, that which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up, even this whole land.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not: for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the LORD: but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest.
