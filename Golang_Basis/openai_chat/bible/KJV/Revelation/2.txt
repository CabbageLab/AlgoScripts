<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> And I will give him the morning star.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.
