<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> But he spake of the temple of his body.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.
