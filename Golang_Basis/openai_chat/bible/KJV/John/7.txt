<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> For neither did his brethren believe in him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>41</bmstyle> Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>42</bmstyle> Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>43</bmstyle> So there was a division among the people because of him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>44</bmstyle> And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>45</bmstyle> Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>46</bmstyle> The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>47</bmstyle> Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>48</bmstyle> Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>49</bmstyle> But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>50</bmstyle> Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>51</bmstyle> Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>52</bmstyle> They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>53</bmstyle> And every man went unto his own house.
