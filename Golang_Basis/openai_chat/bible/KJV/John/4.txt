<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And he must needs go through Samaria.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>41</bmstyle> And many more believed because of his own word;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>42</bmstyle> And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>43</bmstyle> Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>44</bmstyle> For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>45</bmstyle> Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>46</bmstyle> So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>47</bmstyle> When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>48</bmstyle> Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>49</bmstyle> The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>50</bmstyle> Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>51</bmstyle> And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>52</bmstyle> Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>53</bmstyle> So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>54</bmstyle> This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.
