<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> As he spake these words, many believed on him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>41</bmstyle> Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>42</bmstyle> Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>43</bmstyle> Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>44</bmstyle> Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>45</bmstyle> And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>46</bmstyle> Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>47</bmstyle> He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>48</bmstyle> Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>49</bmstyle> Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>50</bmstyle> And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>51</bmstyle> Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>52</bmstyle> Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>53</bmstyle> Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>54</bmstyle> Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>55</bmstyle> Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>56</bmstyle> Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>57</bmstyle> Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>58</bmstyle> Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>59</bmstyle> Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.
