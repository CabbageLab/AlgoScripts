<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> I and my Father are one.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>41</bmstyle> And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>42</bmstyle> And many believed on him there.
