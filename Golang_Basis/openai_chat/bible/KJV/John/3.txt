<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> For John was not yet cast into prison.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> He must increase, but I must decrease.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.
