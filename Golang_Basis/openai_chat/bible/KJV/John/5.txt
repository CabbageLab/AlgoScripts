<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>41</bmstyle> I receive not honour from men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>42</bmstyle> But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>43</bmstyle> I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>44</bmstyle> How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>45</bmstyle> Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>46</bmstyle> For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>47</bmstyle> But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?
