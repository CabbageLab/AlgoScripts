<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> This he said, signifying what death he should die.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>41</bmstyle> These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>42</bmstyle> Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>43</bmstyle> For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>44</bmstyle> Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>45</bmstyle> And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>46</bmstyle> I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>47</bmstyle> And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>48</bmstyle> He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>49</bmstyle> For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>50</bmstyle> And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.
