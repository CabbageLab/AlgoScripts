<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Of sin, because they believe not on me;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.
