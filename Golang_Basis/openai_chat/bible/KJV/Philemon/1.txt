<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. [Written from Rome to Philemon, by Onesimus a servant.]
