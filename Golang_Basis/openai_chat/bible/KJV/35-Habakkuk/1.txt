<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there are that raise up strife and contention.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for I will work a work in your days, which ye will not believe, though it be told you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces that are not theirs.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, imputing this his power unto his god.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Art thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their meat plenteous.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?
