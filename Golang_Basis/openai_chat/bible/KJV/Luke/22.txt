<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>41</bmstyle> And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>42</bmstyle> Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>43</bmstyle> And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>44</bmstyle> And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>45</bmstyle> And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>46</bmstyle> And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>47</bmstyle> And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>48</bmstyle> But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>49</bmstyle> When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>50</bmstyle> And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>51</bmstyle> And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>52</bmstyle> Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>53</bmstyle> When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>54</bmstyle> Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>55</bmstyle> And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>56</bmstyle> But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>57</bmstyle> And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>58</bmstyle> And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>59</bmstyle> And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>60</bmstyle> And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>61</bmstyle> And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>62</bmstyle> And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>63</bmstyle> And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>64</bmstyle> And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>65</bmstyle> And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>66</bmstyle> And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>67</bmstyle> Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>68</bmstyle> And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>69</bmstyle> Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>70</bmstyle> Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>71</bmstyle> And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.
