<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.
