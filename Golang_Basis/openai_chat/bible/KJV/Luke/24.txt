<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And they remembered his words,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And they talked together of all these things which had happened.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>41</bmstyle> And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>42</bmstyle> And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>43</bmstyle> And he took it, and did eat before them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>44</bmstyle> And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>45</bmstyle> Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>46</bmstyle> And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>47</bmstyle> And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>48</bmstyle> And ye are witnesses of these things.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>49</bmstyle> And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>50</bmstyle> And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>51</bmstyle> And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>52</bmstyle> And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>53</bmstyle> And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
