<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after them, nor follow them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> Remember Lot's wife.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together.
