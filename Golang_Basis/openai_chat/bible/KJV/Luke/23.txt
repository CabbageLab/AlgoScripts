<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> I will therefore chastise him, and release him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>41</bmstyle> And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>42</bmstyle> And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>43</bmstyle> And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>44</bmstyle> And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>45</bmstyle> And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>46</bmstyle> And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>47</bmstyle> Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>48</bmstyle> And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>49</bmstyle> And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>50</bmstyle> And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>51</bmstyle> (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>52</bmstyle> This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>53</bmstyle> And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>54</bmstyle> And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>55</bmstyle> And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>56</bmstyle> And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.
