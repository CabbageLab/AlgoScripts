<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our reproach.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers are as widows.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Our necks are under persecution: we labour, and have no rest.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their iniquities.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Servants have ruled over us: there is none that doth deliver us out of their hand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> We gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> They ravished the women in Zion, and the maids in the cities of Judah.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honoured.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their musick.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> The crown is fallen from our head: woe unto us, that we have sinned!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> For this our heart is faint; for these things our eyes are dim.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to generation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so long time?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us.
