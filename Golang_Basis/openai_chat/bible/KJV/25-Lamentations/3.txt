<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> I am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand against me all the day.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret places.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> It is of the LORD'S mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it upon him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> For the Lord will not cast off for ever:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>41</bmstyle> Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>42</bmstyle> We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>43</bmstyle> Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>44</bmstyle> Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should not pass through.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>45</bmstyle> Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>46</bmstyle> All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>47</bmstyle> Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>48</bmstyle> Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>49</bmstyle> Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>50</bmstyle> Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>51</bmstyle> Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>52</bmstyle> Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>53</bmstyle> They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>54</bmstyle> Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>55</bmstyle> I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>56</bmstyle> Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>57</bmstyle> Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>58</bmstyle> O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>59</bmstyle> O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>60</bmstyle> Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>61</bmstyle> Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their imaginations against me;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>62</bmstyle> The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>63</bmstyle> Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their musick.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>64</bmstyle> Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of their hands.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>65</bmstyle> Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>66</bmstyle> Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD.
