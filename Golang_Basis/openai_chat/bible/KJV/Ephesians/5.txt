<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Be not ye therefore partakers with them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.
