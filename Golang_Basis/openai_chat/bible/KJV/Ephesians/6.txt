<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;)

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen. [To the Ephesians written from Rome, by Tychicus.]
