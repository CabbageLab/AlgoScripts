<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.
