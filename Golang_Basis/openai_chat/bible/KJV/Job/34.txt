<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Furthermore Elihu answered and said,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.
