<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before the hills?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou, which is not in us?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on his flanks.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.
