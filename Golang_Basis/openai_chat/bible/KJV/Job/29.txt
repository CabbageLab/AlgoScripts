<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkness;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners.
