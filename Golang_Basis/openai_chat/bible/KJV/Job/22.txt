<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and he shall save the humble person.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.
