<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Then Job answered the LORD, and said,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.
