<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> And Job answered and said,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.
