<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;)

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away.
