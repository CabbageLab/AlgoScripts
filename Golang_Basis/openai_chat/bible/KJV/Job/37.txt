<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart.
