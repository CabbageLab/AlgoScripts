<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail against him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be ready at his side.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God.
