<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.
