<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Which make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave those which have sinned.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?
