<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the dayspring to know his place;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is the place thereof,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the number of thy days is great?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east wind upon the earth?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we are?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>41</bmstyle> Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.
