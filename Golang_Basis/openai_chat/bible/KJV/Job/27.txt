<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus altogether vain?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper maketh.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he is not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.
