<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And Job spake, and said,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.
