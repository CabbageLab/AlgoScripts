<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Then Job answered and said,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me.
