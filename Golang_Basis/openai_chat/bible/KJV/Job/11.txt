<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> For vain man would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass's colt.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that pass away:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday; thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.
