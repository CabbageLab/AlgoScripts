<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Then Job answered and said,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him with my mouth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children's sake of mine own body.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.
