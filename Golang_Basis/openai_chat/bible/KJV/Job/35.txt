<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Elihu spake moreover, and said,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.
