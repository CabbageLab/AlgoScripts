<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.
