<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust.
