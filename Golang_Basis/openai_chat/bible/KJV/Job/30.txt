<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age was perished?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their meat.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as after a thief;)

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> To dwell in the clifts of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the poor?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.
