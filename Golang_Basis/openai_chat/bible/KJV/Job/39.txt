<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barn?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers: her labour is in vain without fear;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she.
