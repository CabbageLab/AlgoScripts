<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and understood it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what will.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be justified.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten.
