<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down: according to his substance shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike him through.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.
