<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not seen:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above rubies.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.
