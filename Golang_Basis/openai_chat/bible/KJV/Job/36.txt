<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Elihu also proceeded, and said,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.
