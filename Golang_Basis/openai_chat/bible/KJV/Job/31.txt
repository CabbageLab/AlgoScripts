<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> For what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid wait at my neighbour's door;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;)

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> If I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten much;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors to the traveller.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.
