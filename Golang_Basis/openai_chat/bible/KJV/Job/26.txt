<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> But Job answered and said,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?
