<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:)

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.
