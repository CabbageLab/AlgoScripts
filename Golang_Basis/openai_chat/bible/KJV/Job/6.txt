<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> But Job answered and said,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?
