<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.
