<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Then Job answered and said,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return.
