<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Then Job answered and said,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat!

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he covered the darkness from my face.
