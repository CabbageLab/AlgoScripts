<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.
