<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> But Job answered and said,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?
