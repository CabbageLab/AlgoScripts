<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Let not then your good be evil spoken of:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.
