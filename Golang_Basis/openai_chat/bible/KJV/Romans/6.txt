<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> For he that is dead is freed from sin.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
