<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
