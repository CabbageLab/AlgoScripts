<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.
