<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> (Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.
