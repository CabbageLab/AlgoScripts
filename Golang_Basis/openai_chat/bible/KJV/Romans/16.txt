<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my wellbeloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellowprisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute them which are of Aristobulus' household.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the household of Narcissus, which are in the Lord.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute the beloved Persis, which laboured much in the Lord.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren which are with them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints which are with them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus a brother.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen. [Written to the Romans from Corinthus, and sent by Phebe servant of the church at Cenchrea.]
