<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Their feet are swift to shed blood:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Destruction and misery are in their ways:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And the way of peace have they not known:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> There is no fear of God before their eyes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.
