<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
