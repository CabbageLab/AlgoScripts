<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>34</bmstyle> Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>35</bmstyle> But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>36</bmstyle> Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>37</bmstyle> And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>38</bmstyle> But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>39</bmstyle> All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>40</bmstyle> There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>41</bmstyle> There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>42</bmstyle> So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>43</bmstyle> It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>44</bmstyle> It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>45</bmstyle> And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>46</bmstyle> Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>47</bmstyle> The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>48</bmstyle> As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>49</bmstyle> And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>50</bmstyle> Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>51</bmstyle> Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>52</bmstyle> In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>53</bmstyle> For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>54</bmstyle> So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>55</bmstyle> O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>56</bmstyle> The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>57</bmstyle> But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>58</bmstyle> Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.
