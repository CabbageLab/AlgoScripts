<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.
