<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> And ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.
