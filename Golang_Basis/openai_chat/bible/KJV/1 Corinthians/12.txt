<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> For the body is not one member, but many.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> And if they were all one member, where were the body?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> But now are they many members, yet but one body.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.
