<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.
