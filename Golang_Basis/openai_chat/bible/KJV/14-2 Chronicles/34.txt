<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>1</bmstyle> Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>2</bmstyle> And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither to the right hand, nor to the left.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>3</bmstyle> For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>4</bmstyle> And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust of them, and strowed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>5</bmstyle> And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>6</bmstyle> And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>7</bmstyle> And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>8</bmstyle> Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>9</bmstyle> And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>10</bmstyle> And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and amend the house:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>11</bmstyle> Even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>12</bmstyle> And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and other of the Levites, all that could skill of instruments of musick.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>13</bmstyle> Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>14</bmstyle> And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD given by Moses.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>15</bmstyle> And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>16</bmstyle> And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they do it.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>17</bmstyle> And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>18</bmstyle> Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>19</bmstyle> And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>20</bmstyle> And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king's, saying,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>21</bmstyle> Go, enquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do after all that is written in this book.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>22</bmstyle> And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spake to her to that effect.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>23</bmstyle> And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell ye the man that sent you to me,

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>24</bmstyle> Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah:

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>25</bmstyle> Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>26</bmstyle> And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard;

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>27</bmstyle> Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard thee also, saith the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>28</bmstyle> Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>29</bmstyle> Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>30</bmstyle> And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>31</bmstyle> And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>32</bmstyle> And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.

<bmstyle color=#ADADAD font-size=14>33</bmstyle> And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the LORD their God. And all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.
